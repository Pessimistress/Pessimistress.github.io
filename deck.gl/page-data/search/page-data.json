Users can quickly get impressive visual results with minimal effort by composing existing layers, or leverage deck.gl's extensible architecture to address custom needs. deck.gl maps  data  (usually an array of JSON objects) into a stack of visual  layers  - e.g. icons, polygons, texts; and look at them with  views : e.g. map, first-person, orthographic. deck.gl handles a number of challenges out of the box: Performant rendering and updating of large data sets Interactive event handling such as picking, highlighting and filtering Cartographic projections and integration with major basemap providers including Mapbox, Google Maps and ESRI A catalog of proven, well-tested layers Deck.gl is designed to be highly customizable. All layers come with flexible APIs to allow programmatic control of each aspect of the rendering. All core classes such are easily extendable by the users to address custom use cases.

In particular, luma.gl does not claim ownership of the WebGL context, and can work with any supplied context, including contexts created by the application or other WebGL libraries. loaders.gl  - a suite of framework-independent loaders for file formats focused on visualization of big data, including point clouds, 3D geometries, images, geospatial formats as well as tabular data. react-map-gl  - A React wrapper around Mapbox GL which works seamlessly with deck.gl. nebula.gl  - A high-performance feature editing framework for deck.gl. Learning deck.gl How you approach learning deck.gl will depend on your previous knowledge and how you want to use it. Getting familiar with the various layers and their props, and reading the basic articles in the deck.gl developer guide should of course be one of the first steps. Exploring the deck.gl examples is a good starting point. In-depth tutorials for how to develop deck.gl applications are available on the  Vis Academy  website. And our  blog  contains a lot of additional information that might be helpful. But where to go after that? Learning Reactive UI Programming deck.gl is designed according to functional UI programming principles, popularized by frameworks like React. The key to writing good, performant deck.gl applications and layers lies in knowing how to minimize updates and redundant calculations, understanding concepts like \"shallow equality\" etc. This is critical when using deck.gl with React, but can still be helpful to understand when using deck.gl in non-React contexts. There is an impressive amount of information (documentation, blog posts, educational videos, etc.) on the reactive programming paradigm in relation to modern web frameworks such as React, Flux and Redux. Where to start depends mostly on your application architecture choices. Exploring such information will take you beyond what we can cover in the basic deck.gl developer guide article on Updates. Understanding WebGL Knowledge of WebGL is only needed if you want to create custom layers in deck.gl. Note that while trying out a new ambitious rendering approach for a new layer will likely require deeper knowledge, it is often possible to modify or extend existing deck.gl layers (including modifying the shader code) with a surprisingly limited amount of WebGL knowledge. There are many web resources for learning WebGL.  luma.gl  can be a good start.","headings":[{"value":"Introduction","depth":1},{"value":"Flavors","depth":2},{"value":"Script Tag","depth":3},{"value":"NPM Module","depth":3},{"value":"Pure JS","depth":4},{"value":"React","depth":4},{"value":"Python","depth":3},{"value":"Third-Party Bindings","depth":3},{"value":"Ecosystem","depth":2},{"value":"Learning deck.gl","depth":2},{"value":"Learning Reactive UI Programming","depth":3},{"value":"Understanding WebGL","depth":3}],"slug":"docs","title":"Introduction"},{"excerpt":"Installing and Running Examples Installation To install the deck.gl framework: or The  deck.gl  module includes all deck.gl features and their dependencies. If you want to selectively install a subset of the features, see the  Dependencies  section below. Running the Examples The deck.gl repository contains an  examples folder  with a selection of small, standalone examples that could be good starting points for your application. You should be able to copy these folders to your preferred locations, and get them running simply as follows: Clone the deck.gl repo, if you haven't already For most consistent results, it is recommended that you check out the latest release branch (e.g.  8.0-release ) instead of  master  when running examples. Change directory to the example you are interested in, e.g. Then install dependencies using the installer of your choice: and then running using: If the example uses a mapbox base map you need a  Mapbox access token If you want to build the example against the latest deck.gl source code in the cloned repo (rather than the published version of deck.gl listed in the examples  package.json ) The examples on the  master  branch are updated to use features from the latest, unreleased version of deck.gl. If some example doesn't work using  npm start  it can be worth trying  npm run start-local . While all examples support  npm run start-local , there are some caveats when running against local source. Most importantly, you must make sure to run  npm install  or  yarn  in the deck.gl root folder before running  npm run start-local  in an example folder. Selectively Install Dependencies A family of NPM modules are published as part of the deck.gl framework. The following tree shows their scope and dependencies: @deck.gl/core  - Core module that handles the WebGL rendering pipeline, data management, and user interaction @deck.gl/layers  - Primitive layers that are the building blocks of all visualizations @deck.gl/aggregation-layers  - Advanced layers that aggregate data into alternative representations, e.g. heatmap, contour, hex bins, etc. @deck.gl/geo-layers  - Additional layers that handle geospatial use cases and GIS formats. @deck.gl/mesh-layers  - Additional layers that render 3D meshes and  scene graphs . @deck.gl/json  - Declarative interface that supports specifying deck.gl layers and views using a JSON format. @deck.gl/mapbox  - An integration with the  Mapbox custom layer  API. @deck.gl/react  - React wrapper of deck.gl. @deck.gl/test-utils  - Testing utilities. For example, to render a  PointCloudLayer , you may install: To use the  HexagonLayer  with React, you need to install: While installing submodules separately affords applications the maximum control over the dependencies that it pulls in, the submodule versions are expected to be synchronized manually in order to produce consistent results. The  deck.gl  master module includes all submodules except for  @deck.gl/test-utils . Most bundling solutions (Webpack, Rollup etc.) offer tree-shaking capabilities that exclude unused exports from a production build.","headings":[{"value":"Installing and Running Examples","depth":1},{"value":"Installation","depth":2},{"value":"Running the Examples","depth":2},{"value":"Selectively Install Dependencies","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/get-started/getting-started","title":"Installing and Running Examples"},{"excerpt":"Frequently Asked Questions deck.gl is designed to be easy to use, however it is built on top of a complex technology (WebGL) and supports a functional/reactive programming paradigm which many users are initially unfamiliar with. Installing npm modules, learning React, it is just too much! Not to worry, there are easier ways to use deck.gl: Scripting  - deck.gl has a scripting API that allows you get started just by adding a  <script>  statement to your HTML to use standard JavaScript. For an easy introduction to deck.gl scripting, see our  blog post . JSON Layers  - It is even possible to use deck.gl without programming, by specifying deck.gl layers using a simple JSON format. See  JSON Layer Browser . kepler.gl  - If scripting JSON is also too much, and you just want to play around with deck.gl visualizations in a polished application user interface, please check out  kepler.gl . Layer pixels render randomly on top of each other You are likely experiencing a well-known issue in 3D graphics known as Z-fighting. The good news is that there are many ways to mitigate Z-fighting and deck.gl provides several mechanisms to help you. To get started, see the  tips and tricks  article. Should I really regenerate all layers every time something changes? Q: If I wanted to, say, change the opacity of a layer, Is my only option to create a new layer with the same Id and different properties? Yes. deck.gl is a \"reactive\" application architecture and is optimized to be used like this. The layer and its props are essentially only a \"descriptor\", deck.gl matches and \"diffs\" the layers under the hood and only does the necessary changes based on actual differences compared to last layer. This is a \"functional\" take on programming, and it parallels key ideas in the widely used React library. The reactive architecture has big benefits when writing larger prgrams, but these are not as evident when writing smaller scripts. If you are coming from a more \"imperative\" programming experience, it can initially seem a little counter-intuitive (especially from a performance perspective). But in spite of how the API looks, performance should be very good, if this is not the case you are likely doing something else wrong. For more information, see the article about  updates . I can't \"extend\" my Custom Layer Q: Why does deck.gl call  Object.seal  on the  Layer  base class? I can't add members to my subclass. An important thing to understand about layer instances is that they are essentially just \"disposable descriptors\". All permanent state is stored in the  layer.state  object, which \"moves\" between layers. Every time you change your layer, you create a new layer and pass it to Deck or DeckGL. Internally DeckGL matches new layers with old layers, and the old layers are released for garbage collection. So storing data on the layer itself typically does not make sense. How do I  debug  deck.gl applications? Both deck.gl and luma.gl have powerful logging capabilities. See the article about  debugging . How do I  test  deck.gl applications? Q: It is hard to test webgl based applications, assuming deck.gl is no different? Check out  @deck.gl/test-utils , which (among other things) supports visual regression testing.","headings":[{"value":"Frequently Asked Questions","depth":1},{"value":"Installing npm modules, learning React, it is just too much!","depth":2},{"value":"Layer pixels render randomly on top of each other","depth":2},{"value":"Should I really regenerate all layers every time something changes?","depth":2},{"value":"I can't \"extend\" my Custom Layer","depth":2},{"value":"How do I debug deck.gl applications?","depth":2},{"value":"How do I test deck.gl applications?","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/faq","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"excerpt":"Upgrade Guide Upgrading from deck.gl v8.3 to v8.4 wrapLongitude The behavior of  wrapLongitude  has changed. Before, setting this prop to  true  would project vertices to a copy of the map that is closer to the current center. Starting with v8.4, enabling this prop would \"normalize\" the geometry to the  -180, 180  longitude range. See the following list for layer-specific changes: LineLayer  and  ArcLayer : always draw the shortest path between source and target positions. If the shortest path crosses the 180th meridian, it is split into two segments. This change makes layers render more predictably at low zoom levels. To draw horizontally continuous map with multiple copies of the world, use  MapView  with the  repeat  option: Upgrading from deck.gl v8.2 to v8.3 The following is added to the default image loading options:  {imagebitmap: {premultiplyAlpha: 'none'}}  (previously  default ). This generates more visually similar outcome between  ImageBitmap  and  Image  formats (see changes in 8.2 below). You can override this behavior with the  loadOptions  prop of a layer. See  ImageLoader options  for more information. Upgrading from deck.gl v8.1 to v8.2 The  TileLayer  now rounds the current  zoom  to determine the  z  at which to load tiles. This will load less tiles than the previous version. You can adjust the  tileSize  prop to modify this behavior. Image URLs are now by default loaded in the  ImageBitmap  format, versus  Image  in the previous version. This improves the performance of loading textures. You may override this by supplying the  loadOptions  prop of a layer: See  ImageLoader options ; Upgrading from deck.gl v8.0 to v8.1 Breaking Changes s2-geometry  is no longer a dependency of  @deck.gl/geo-layers . If you were using this module in an application, it needs to be explicitly added to package.json. deck.gl no longer crashes if one of the layers encounters an error during update and/or render. By default, errors are now logged to the console. Specify the  onError  callback to manually handle errors in your application. Deck  now reacts to changes in the  initialViewState  prop. In 8.0 and earlier versions, this prop was not monitored after the deck instance was constructed. Starting 8.1, if  initialViewState  changes deeply, the camera will be reset. It is recommended that you use a constant for  initialViewState  to achieve behavior consistent with the previous versions. Tile3DLayer A new prop  loader  needs to be provided, one of  CesiumIonLoader ,  Tiles3DLoader  from ( @loaders.gl/3d-tiles ) or  I3SLoader  from ( @loaders.gl/i3s ). The  loadOptions  prop is now used for passing all loaders.gl options, not just  Tileset3D . To revert back to the 8.0 behavior, use  {tileset: {throttleRequest: true}} . _ionAccessId  and  _ionAccesToken  props are removed. To render an ion dataset with  Tile3DLayer , follow this example: Upgrading from deck.gl v7.x to v8.0 Breaking Changes Defaults The  opacity  prop of all layers is now default to  1  (used to be  0.8 ). SimpleMeshLayer  and  ScenegraphLayer :  modelMatrix  will be composed to instance transformation matrix (derived from  layer props  getOrientation ,  getScale ,  getTranslation  and  getTransformMatrix ) under  CARTESIAN  and  METER_OFFSETS   coordinates . Removed ArcLayer  props getStrokeWidth : use  getWidth LineLayer  props getStrokeWidth : use  getWidth PathLayer  props getDashArray : use  PathStyleExtension PolygonLayer  and  GeoJsonLayer  props getLineDashArray : use  PathStyleExtension H3HexagonLayer  props getColor : use  getFillColor  and  getLineColor Tile3DLayer  props: onTileLoadFail : use  onTileError TileLayer  props: onViewportLoaded : use  onViewportLoad project  shader module project_scale : use  project_size project_to_clipspace : use  project_position_to_clipspace project_pixel_to_clipspace : use  project_pixel_size_to_clipspace WebMercatorViewport  class getLocationAtPoint : use  getMapCenterByLngLatPosition lngLatDeltaToMeters metersToLngLatDelta Layer  class setLayerNeedsUpdate : use  setNeedsUpdate setUniforms : use  model.setUniforms use64bitProjection projectFlat : use  projectPosition PerspectiveView  class - use  FirstPersonView ThirdPersonView  class - use  MapView  (geospatial) or  OrbitView  (info-vis) COORDINATE_SYSTEM  enum LNGLAT_DEPRECATED : use  LNGLAT METERS : use  METER_OFFSETS React DeckGL  no longer injects its children with view props ( width ,  height ,  viewState  etc.). If your custom component needs these props, consider using the  ContextProvider  or a render callback: The children of  DeckGL  are now placed above the canvas by default (except the react-map-gl base map). Wrap them in e.g.  <div style={{zIndex: -1}}>  if they are intended to be placed behind the canvas. Debugging deck.gl now removes most logging when bundling under  NODE_ENV=production . Standalone bundle The pre-bundled version, a.k.a. the  scripting API  has been aligned with the interface of the core  Deck  class. Top-level view state props such as  longitude ,  latitude ,  zoom  are no longer supported. To specify the default view state, use  initialViewState . controller  is no longer on by default, use  controller: true . Textures In older versions of deck, we used to set  UNPACK_FLIP_Y_WEBGL  by default when creating textures from images. This is removed in v8.0 to better align with  WebGL best practice . As a result, the texCoords in the shaders of  BitmapLayer ,  IconLayer  and  TextLayer  are y-flipped. This only affects users who extend these layers. Users of  SimpleMeshLayer  with texture will need to flip their texture image vertically. The change has allowed us to support loading textures from  ImageBitmap , in use cases such as rendering to  OffscreenCanvas  on a web worker. projection system The  common space  is no longer scaled to the current zoom level. This is part of an effort to make the geometry calculation more consistent and predictable. While one old common unit is equivalent to 1 screen pixel at the viewport center, one new common unit is equivalent to  viewport.scale  pixels at the viewport center. viewport.distanceScales  keys are renamed: pixelsPerMeter  ->  unitsPerMeter metersPerPixel  ->  metersPerUnit Low part of a  DOUBLE  attribute is renamed from  *64xyLow  to  *64Low  and uses the same size as the high part. This mainly affect position attributes, e.g. all  vec2 positions64xyLow  and  vec2 instancePositions64xyLow  are now  vec3 positions64Low  and  vec3 instancePositions64Low . project :  vec3 project_position(vec3 position, vec2 position64xyLow)  is now  vec3 project_position(vec3 position, vec3 position64Low) . project :  vec4 project_position(vec4 position, vec2 position64xyLow)  is now  vec4 project_position(vec4 position, vec3 position64Low) . project32  and  project64 :  vec4 project_position_to_clipspace(vec3 position, vec2 position64xyLow, vec3 offset)  is now  vec4 project_position_to_clipspace(vec3 position, vec3 position64Low, vec3 offset) . The shader module  project64  is no longer included in  @deck.gl/core  and  deck.gl . You can still import it from  @deck.gl/extensions . Shader modules This change affects custom layers. deck.gl is no longer registering shaders by default. This means any  modules  array defined in  layer.getShaders()  or  new Model()  must now use the full shader module objects, instead of just their names. All supported shader modules can be imported from  @deck.gl/core . Should now become Auto view state update A bug was fixed where initial view state tracking could sometimes overwrite user-provided  viewState  prop. Apps that rely on auto view state update by specifying  initialViewState  should make sure that  viewState  is never assigned. If manual view state update is desired, use  viewState  and  onViewStateChange  instead. See  developer guide  for examples. We have fixed a bug when using  initialViewState  with multiple views. In the past, the state change in one view is unintendedly propagated to all views. As a result of this fix, multiple views (e.g. mini map) are no longer synchronized by default. To synchronize them, define the views with an explicit  viewState.id : See  View class  documentation for details. Upgrading from deck.gl v7.2 to v7.3 Core layer.setLayerNeedsUpdate  is renamed to  layer.setNeedsUpdate()  and the old name will be removed in the next major release. Previously deprecated  Layer  class method,  screenToDevicePixels , is removed. Use luma.gl  utility methods  instead. Layers ScreenGridLayer : support is now limited to browsers that implement either WebGL2 or the  OES_texture_float  extension.  coverage stats Some shader attributes are renamed for consistency: Layer Old New LineLayer instanceSourceTargetPositions64xyLow.xy instanceSourcePositions64xyLow instanceSourceTargetPositions64xyLow.zw instanceTargetPositions64xyLow PathLayer instanceLeftStartPositions64xyLow.xy instanceLeftPositions64xyLow instanceLeftStartPositions64xyLow.zw instanceStartPositions64xyLow instanceEndRightPositions64xyLow.xy instanceEndPositions64xyLow instanceEndRightPositions64xyLow.zw instanceRightPositions64xyLow ArcLayer instancePositions64Low instancePositions64xyLow ScenegraphLayer instancePositions64xy instancePositions64xyLow SimpleMeshLayer instancePositions64xy instancePositions64xyLow @deck.gl/json Non-breaking Change: The  _JSONConverter  class has been renamed to  JSONConverter  (deprecated alias still available). Non-breaking Change: The  _JSONConverter.convertJson()  method has been renamed to  JSONConverter.convert()   (deprecated stub still available). Breaking Change: The  _JSONConverter  no longer automatically injects deck.gl  View  classes and enumerations. If required need to import and add these to your  JSONConfiguration . Removed: The  JSONLayer  is no longer included in this module. The code for this layer has been moved to an example in  /test/apps/json-layer , and would need to be copied into applications to be used. Upgrading from deck.gl v7.1 to v7.2 Breaking Changes Layer methods Following  Layer  class methods have been removed : Removed Alternate Comment use64bitProjection use  Fp64Extension details in  fp64 prop  section below is64bitEnabled use  Fp64Extension details in  fp64 prop  section below updateAttributes _updateAttributes method is renamed fp64 prop The deprecated  fp64  prop is removed. The current 32-bit projection is generally precise enough for almost all use cases. If you previously use this feature:   It can be changed to: Color Attributes and Uniforms All core layer shaders now receive  normalized  color attributes and uniforms. If you were previously subclassing a core layer with custom vertex shaders, you should expect the color attributes to be in  [0, 1]  range instead of  [0, 255] . project64 Shader Module The  project64  shader module is no longer registered by default. If you were previously using a custom layer that depends on this module:   It can be changed to: CPU Grid layer and Hexagon layer updateTriggers getElevationValue ,  getElevationWeight  and  getColorValue ,  getColorWeight  are now compared using  updateTriggers  like other layer  accessors . Update them without passing updateTriggers will no longer trigger layer update. Deprecations IE support is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Upgrading from deck.gl v7.0 to v7.1 Breaking Changes Fixed a bug where  coordinateOrigin 's  z  is not applied in  METER_OFFSETS  and  LNGLAT_OFFSETS  coordinate systems. If your application was subclassing  GridLayer , you should now subclass  CPUGridLayer  instead, and either use it directly, or provide it as the sublayer class for  GridLayer  using  _subLayerProps : Deprecations getColor  props in  ColumnLayer  and  H3HexagonLayer  are deprecated. Use  getLineColor  and  getFillColor  instead. Upgrading from deck.gl v6.4 to v7.0 Submodule Structure and Dependency Changes  @deck.gl/core  is moved from  dependencies  to  devDependencies  for all submodules. This will reduce the runtime error caused by installing multiple copies of the core. The master module  deck.gl  now include all submodules except   @deck.gl/test-utils . See  list of submodules  for details. ContourLayer ,  GridLayer ,  HexagonLayer  and  ScreenGridLayer  are moved from   @deck.gl/layers  to   @deck.gl/aggregation-layers . No action is required if you are importing them from  deck.gl .  @deck.gl/experimental-layers  is deprecated. Experimental layers will be exported from their respective modules with a  _  prefix. BitmapLayer  is moved to   @deck.gl/layers . MeshLayer  is renamed to  SimpleMeshLayer  and moved to   @deck.gl/mesh-layers . TileLayer  and  TripsLayer  are moved to   @deck.gl/geo-layers . Deck Class Breaking Changes: onLayerHover  and  onLayerClick  props are replaced with  onHover  and  onClick . The first argument passed to the callback will always be a valid  picking info  object, and the second argument is the pointer event. This change makes these two events behave consistently with other event callbacks. Layers Deprecations: ArcLayer  and  LineLayer 's  getStrokeWidth  props are deprecated. Use  getWidth  instead. Breaking Changes: HexagonCellLayer  is removed. Use  ColumnLayer  with  diskResolution: 6  instead. A bug in projecting elevation was fixed in  HexagonLayer ,  GridLayer  and  GridCellLayer . The resulting heights of extruded grids/hexagons have changed. You may adjust them to match previous behavior by tweaking  elevationScale . The following former experimental layers' APIs are redesigned as they graduate to official layers. Refer to their documentations for details: BitmapLayer SimpleMeshLayer TileLayer TripsLayer Lighting The old experimental prop  lightSettings  in many 3D layers is no longer supported. The new and improved settings are split into two places: a  material  prop for each 3D layer and a shared set of lights specified by  LightingEffect  with the  effects prop of Deck .\nCheck  Using Lighting  in developer guide for more details. Views v7.0 includes major bug fixes for  OrbitView  and  OrthographicView . Their APIs are also changed for better clarity and consistency. Breaking Changes: View state:  zoom  is now logarithmic in all  View  classes.  zoom: 0  maps one unit in world space to one pixel in screen space. View state:  minZoom  and  maxZoom  now default to no limit. View state:  offset  (pixel-shift of the viewport center) is removed, use  target  (world position  [x, y, z]  of the viewport center) instead. Constructor prop: added  target  to specify the viewport center in world position. OrthographicView 's constructor props  left ,  right ,  top  and  bottom  are removed. Use  target  to specify viewport center. OrbitView 's constructor prop  distance  and static method  getDistance  are removed. Use  fovy  and  zoom  instead. project Shader Module Deprecations: project_scale  ->  project_size project_to_clipspace  ->  project_common_position_to_clipspace project_to_clipspace_fp64  ->  project_common_position_to_clipspace_fp64 project_pixel_to_clipspace  ->  project_pixel_size_to_clipspace React If you are using DeckGL with react-map-gl,   @deck.gl/react@^7.0.0  no longer works with react-map-gl v3.x. Upgrading from deck.gl v6.3 to v6.4 OrthographicView The experimental  OrthographicView  class has the following breaking changes: zoom  is reversed (larger value means zooming in) and switched to logarithmic scale. Changed view state defaults: zoom  -  1  ->  0 offset  -  [0, 1]  ->  [0, 0] minZoom  -  0.1  ->  -10 eye ,  lookAt  and  up  are now set in the   OrthographicView  constructor instead of  viewState . ScatterplotLayer Deprecations: outline  is deprecated: use  stroked  instead. strokeWidth  is deprecated: use  getLineWidth  instead. Note that while  strokeWidth  is in pixels, line width is now specified in meters. The old appearance can be achieved by using  lineWidthMinPixels  and/or  lineWidthMaxPixels . getColor  is deprecated: use  getFillColor  and  getLineColor  instead. Breaking changes: outline  /  stroked  no longer turns off fill. Use  filled: false  instead. GeoJsonLayer Breaking changes: stroked ,  getLineWidth  and  getLineColor  props now apply to point features (rendered with a ScatterplotLayer) in addition to polygon features. To revert to the old appearance, supply a  _subLayerProps  override: Upgrading from deck.gl v6.2 to v6.3 GridLayer and HexagonLayer Shallow changes in  getColorValue  and  getElevationValue  props are now ignored by default. To trigger an update, use the  updateTriggers  prop. This new behavior is aligned with other core layers and improves runtime performance. Prop Types in Custom Layers Although the  prop types system  is largely backward-compatible, it is possible that some custom layers may stop updating when a certain prop changes. This is because the automatically deduced prop type from  defaultProps  does not match its desired usage. Switch to explicit descriptors will fix the issue, e.g. from: To: Upgrading from deck.gl v6.1 to v6.2 fp64 The default coordinate system  COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT  is upgraded to offer high-precision results in a way that is much faster and more cross-platform compatible. The  fp64  layer prop is ignored when using this new coordinate system. You can get the old fp64 mode back by using  coordinateSystem: COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT_DEPRECATED  with  fp64: true . Upgrading from deck.gl v5.3 to v6.0 luma.gl v6.0 deck.gl v6.0 brings in luma.gl v6.0 which is a major release with a few breaking changes. The change that is most likely to affect deck.gl applications is probably that the way the  GL  constant is imported has changed. For details, see to the luma.gl  Upgrade Guide . Pixel sizes Pixel sizes in line, icon and text layers now match their HTML/SVG counterparts. To achieve the same rendering output as v5, you should use half the previous value in the following props: ArcLayer.getStrokeWidth LineLayer.getStrokeWidth IconLayer.getSize  or  IconLayer.sizeScale TextLayer.getSize  or  TextLayer.sizeScale PointCloudLayer.radiusPixels Accessors All layer accessors that support constant values have had their default values changed to constants. For example,  ScatterplotLayer 's default  getRadius  prop is changed from  d => d.radius || 1  to  1 . All dynamic attributes now must be explicitly specified. This change makes sure that using default values results in best performance. Views and Controllers (React only) Viewport constraint props:  maxZoom ,  minZoom ,  maxPitch ,  minPitch  are no longer supported by the  DeckGL  component. They must be specified as part of the  viewState  object. (React only)  ViewportController  React component has been removed. The functionality is now built in to the  Deck  and  DeckGL  classes. Deck.onViewportChange(viewport)  etc callbacks are no longer supported. Use  Deck.onViewStateChange({viewState}) DeckGL.viewport  and  DeckGL.viewports  props are no longer supported. Use  DeckGL.views . ScreenGridLayer minColor  and  maxColor  props are deprecated. Use  colorRange  and  colorDomain  props. Shader Modules Some previously deprecated  project_  module GLSL functions have now been removed. Attribute isGeneric  field of attribute object returned by  AttributeManager 's update callbacks is replaced by  constant . For more details check  attribute manager . Upgrading from deck.gl v5.2 to v5.3 Viewport classes Continuing the changes that started in 5.2: while the base  Viewport  class will remain supported, the various  Viewport  subclasses are now deprecated. For now, if for projection purposes you need to create a  Viewport  instance matching one of your  View  instances you can use  View.makeViewport : Layer properties Layer Removed Prop New Prop Comment ArcLayer strokeWidth getStrokeWidth Can be set to constant value LineLayer strokeWidth getStrokeWidth Can be set to constant value Pure JS applications Core layers are broken out from   @deck.gl/core  to a new submodule   @deck.gl/layers . Non-React users of deck.gl should now install both submodules: And import layers from the new submodule instead of core: Users of  deck.gl  are not affected by this change. Upgrading from deck.gl v5.1 to v5.2 DeckGL component DeckGL.viewports  and  DeckGL.viewport  are deprecated and should be replaced with  DeckGL.views . Viewport classes A number of  Viewport  subclasses have been deprecated. They should be replaced with their  View  counterparts. Experimental Features Some experimental exports have been removed: The experimental React controller components ( MapController  and  OrbitController ) have been removed. These are now replaced with JavaScript classes that can be used with the  Deck.controller  /  DeckGL.controller  property. Upgrading from deck.gl v5 to v5.1 N/A Upgrading from deck.gl v4.1 to v5 Dependencies deck.gl 4.1 requires luma.gl as peer dependency, but 5.0 specifies it as a normal \"dependency\". This means that many applications no longer need to list luma.gl in their package.json. Applications that do might get multiple copies of luma.gl installed, which will not work.  luma.gl will detect this situation during run-time throwing an exception , but  npm and yarn will not detect it during install time . Thus your build can look successful during upgrade but fail during runtime. Layer Props Coordinate system related props have been renamed for clarity. The old props are no longer supported and will generate errors when used. Layer Removed Prop New Prop Comment Layer projectionMode coordinateSystem Any constant from  COORDINATE_SYSTEM Layer projectionOrigin coordinateOrigin lng, lat Note; There is also an important semantical change in that using  coordinateSystem  instead of  projectionMode  causes the superimposed  METER_OFFSET  system's y-axis to point north instead of south. This was always the intention so in some sense this was regarded as a bug fix. DeckGL component Following methods and props have been renamed for clarity. The semantics are unchanged. The old props are still available but will generate a deprecation warning. Old Method New Method Comment queryObject pickObject These names were previously aligned with react-map-gl, but ended up confusing users. Since rest of the deck.gl documentation talks extensively about \"picking\" it made sense to stay with that terminology. queryVisibleObjects pickObjects The word \"visible\" was intended to remind the user that this function only selects the objects that are actually visible in at least one pixel, but again it confused more than it helped. Removed picking Uniforms Removed uniform Comment renderPickingBuffer picking shader module pickingEnabled picking shader module selectedPickingColor picking shader module The shader uniforms are used for implementing picking in custom shaders, these uniforms are no longer set by the deck.gl. Custom shaders can now use luma.gl  picking shader module . Initial WebGL State Following WebGL parameters are set during DeckGL component initialization. WebGL State Value depthTest true depthFunc gl.LEQUAL blendFuncSeparate gl.SRC_ALPHA, gl.ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, gl.ONE, gl.ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA All our layers enable depth test so we are going set this state during initialization. We are also changing blend function for more appropriate rendering when multiple elements are blended. For any custom needs, these parameters can be overwritten by updating them in  onWebGLInitialized  callback or by passing them in  parameters  object to  drawLayer  method of  Layer  class. assembleShaders The  assembleShaders  function was moved to luma.gl in v4.1 and is no longer re-exported from deck.gl. As described in v4.1 upgrade guide please use  Model  class instead or import it from luma.gl. Removed Immutable support ScatterplotLayer  and  PolygonLayer  supported immutable/ES6 containers using  get  method, due to performance reasons this support has been dropped. Upgrading from deck.gl v4 to v4.1 deck.gl v4.1 is a backward-compatible release. Most of the functionality and APIs remain unchanged but there are smaller changes that might requires developers' attention if they  develop custom layers . Note that applications that are only using the provided layers should not need to make any changes issues. Dependencies Be aware that deck.gl 4.1 bumps the luma.gl peer dependency from 3.0 to 4.0. There have been instances where this was not detected by the installer during update. Layer Life Cycle Optimization shouldUpdateState  - deck.gl v4.1 contains additional optimizations of the layer lifecycle and layer diffing algorithms. Most of these changes are completely under the hood but one  visible change is that the default implementation of  Layer.shouldUpdate  no longer returns true if only the viewport has changed. This means that layers that need to update state in response to changes in screen space (viewport) will need to redefine  shouldUpdate : Note that this change has already been done in all the provided deck.gl layers that are screen space based, including the  ScreenGridLayer  and the  HexagonLayer . luma.gl  Model  class API change deck.gl v4.1 bumps luma.gl to from v3 to v4. This is major release that brings full WebGL2 enablement to deck.gl. This should not affect you if you are mainly using the provided deck.gl layers but if you are writing your own layers using luma.gl classes you may want to look at the upgrade guide of luma.gl. The  gl  parameter is provided as a separate argument in luma.gl v4, instead of part of the options object. Shader Assembly Custom layers are  no longer expected  to call  assembleShaders  directly. Instead, the new  Model  class from luma.gl v4 will take shaders and the modules they are using as parameters and assemble shaders automatically. Removed Layers Layer Status Replacement ChoroplethLayer Removed GeoJsonLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  PathLayer ChoroplethLayer64 Removed GeoJsonLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  PathLayer ExtrudedChoroplethLayer Removed GeoJsonLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  PathLayer ChoroplethLayer, ChoroplethLayer64, ExtrudedChoroplethLayer These set of layers were deprecated in deck.gl v4, and are now removed in v5. You can still get same functionality using more unified, flexible and performant layers:\n  GeoJsonLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  PathLayer . Upgrading from deck.gl v3 to v4 Changed Import: The  DeckGL  React component A small but breaking change that will affect all applications is that the 'deck.gl/react' import is no longer available. As of v4.0, the app is required to import deck.gl as follows: While it would have been preferable to avoid this change, a significant modernization of the deck.gl build process and preparations for \"tree-shaking\" support combined to make it impractical to keep supporting the old import style. Deprecated/Removed Layers Layer Status Replacement ChoroplethLayer Deprecated GeoJsonLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  PathLayer ChoroplethLayer64 Deprecated GeoJsonLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  PathLayer ExtrudedChoroplethLayer Deprecated GeoJsonLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  PathLayer EnhancedChoroplethLayer Moved to examples PathLayer ChoroplethLayer, ChoroplethLayer64, ExtrudedChoroplethLayer These set of layers are deprecated in deck.gl v4, with their functionality completely substituted by more unified, flexible and performant new layers:\n  GeoJsonLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  PathLayer . Developers should be able to just supply the same geojson data that are used with  ChoroplethLayer s to the new  GeoJsonLayer . The props of the  GeoJsonLayer  are a bit different from the old  ChoroplethLayer , so proper testing is recommended to achieve satisfactory result. EnhancedChoroplethLayer This was a a sample layer in deck.gl v3 and has now been moved to a stand-alone example and is no longer exported from the deck.gl npm module. Developers can either copy this layer from the example folder into their application's source tree, or consider using the new  PathLayer  which also handles wide lines albeit in a slightly different way. Removed, Changed and Deprecated Layer Properties Layer Old Prop New Prop Comment Layer dataIterator N/A Prop was not functional in v3 ScatterplotLayer radius radiusScale Default has changed from 30 to 1 ScatterplotLayer drawOutline outline ScreenGridLayer unitWidth cellSizePixels ScreenGridLayer unitHeight cellSizePixels Note about  strokeWidth  props All line based layers ( LineLayer and  ArcLayer and the ScatterplotLayer in outline mode) now use use shaders to render an exact pixel thickness on lines, instead of using the GL.LINE` drawing mode. This particular change was caused by browsers dropping support for this feature ( Chrome  and  Firefox ). Also  GL.LINE  mode rendering always had significant limitations in terms of lack of support for mitering, unreliable support for anti-aliasing and platform dependent line width limits so this should represent an improvement in visual quality and consistency for these layers. Removed prop:  Layer.dataIterator This prop has been removed in deck.gl v4. Note that it was not functioning as documented in deck.gl v3. Renamed Props: The  ...Scale  suffix Props that have their name end of  Scale  is a set of props that multiply some existing value for all objects in the layers. These props usually correspond to WebGL shader uniforms that \"scaling\" all values of specific attributes simultaneously. For API consistency reasons these have all been renamed with the suffix  ..Scale . See the property table above. Removed lifecycle method:  Layer.willReceiveProps This lifecycle was deprecated in v3 and is now removed in v4. Use  Layer.updateState  instead. Changes to  updateTriggers Update triggers can now be specified by referring to the name of the accessor, instead of the name of the actual WebGL attribute. Note that this is supported on all layers supplied by deck.gl v4, but if you are using older layers, they need a small addition to their attribute definitions to specify the name of the accessor. AttributeManager changes Removed method:  AttributeManager.setLogFunctions Use the new static function  AttributeManager.setDefaultLogFunctions  to set loggers for all AttributeManagers (i.e. for all layers). Removed method:  AttributeManager.addDynamic This method has been deprecated since version 2.5 and is now removed in v4. Use  AttributeManager.add()  instead.","headings":[{"value":"Upgrade Guide","depth":1},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v8.3 to v8.4","depth":2},{"value":"wrapLongitude","depth":3},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v8.2 to v8.3","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v8.1 to v8.2","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v8.0 to v8.1","depth":2},{"value":"Breaking Changes","depth":3},{"value":"Tile3DLayer","depth":5},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v7.x to v8.0","depth":2},{"value":"Breaking Changes","depth":3},{"value":"Defaults","depth":5},{"value":"Removed","depth":5},{"value":"React","depth":5},{"value":"Debugging","depth":5},{"value":"Standalone bundle","depth":5},{"value":"Textures","depth":5},{"value":"projection system","depth":5},{"value":"Shader modules","depth":5},{"value":"Auto view state update","depth":5},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v7.2 to v7.3","depth":2},{"value":"Core","depth":4},{"value":"Layers","depth":4},{"value":"@deck.gl/json","depth":4},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v7.1 to v7.2","depth":2},{"value":"Breaking Changes","depth":4},{"value":"Layer methods","depth":5},{"value":"fp64 prop","depth":5},{"value":"Color Attributes and Uniforms","depth":5},{"value":"project64 Shader Module","depth":5},{"value":"CPU Grid layer and Hexagon layer updateTriggers","depth":4},{"value":"Deprecations","depth":4},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v7.0 to v7.1","depth":2},{"value":"Breaking Changes","depth":4},{"value":"Deprecations","depth":4},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v6.4 to v7.0","depth":2},{"value":"Submodule Structure and Dependency Changes","depth":4},{"value":"Deck Class","depth":4},{"value":"Layers","depth":4},{"value":"Lighting","depth":4},{"value":"Views","depth":4},{"value":"project Shader Module","depth":4},{"value":"React","depth":4},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v6.3 to v6.4","depth":2},{"value":"OrthographicView","depth":4},{"value":"ScatterplotLayer","depth":4},{"value":"GeoJsonLayer","depth":4},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v6.2 to v6.3","depth":2},{"value":"GridLayer and HexagonLayer","depth":4},{"value":"Prop Types in Custom Layers","depth":4},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v6.1 to v6.2","depth":2},{"value":"fp64","depth":4},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v5.3 to v6.0","depth":2},{"value":"luma.gl v6.0","depth":4},{"value":"Pixel sizes","depth":4},{"value":"Accessors","depth":4},{"value":"Views and Controllers","depth":4},{"value":"ScreenGridLayer","depth":4},{"value":"Shader Modules","depth":4},{"value":"Attribute","depth":4},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v5.2 to v5.3","depth":2},{"value":"Viewport classes","depth":3},{"value":"Layer properties","depth":3},{"value":"Pure JS applications","depth":3},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v5.1 to v5.2","depth":2},{"value":"DeckGL component","depth":3},{"value":"Viewport classes","depth":3},{"value":"Experimental Features","depth":3},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v5 to v5.1","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v4.1 to v5","depth":2},{"value":"Dependencies","depth":3},{"value":"Layer Props","depth":3},{"value":"DeckGL component","depth":3},{"value":"Removed picking Uniforms","depth":3},{"value":"Initial WebGL State","depth":3},{"value":"assembleShaders","depth":3},{"value":"Removed Immutable support","depth":3},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v4 to v4.1","depth":2},{"value":"Dependencies","depth":3},{"value":"Layer Life Cycle Optimization","depth":3},{"value":"luma.gl Model class API change","depth":3},{"value":"Shader Assembly","depth":3},{"value":"Removed Layers","depth":3},{"value":"Upgrading from deck.gl v3 to v4","depth":2},{"value":"Changed Import: The DeckGL React component","depth":3},{"value":"Deprecated/Removed Layers","depth":3},{"value":"Removed, Changed and Deprecated Layer Properties","depth":3},{"value":"Note about strokeWidth props","depth":4},{"value":"Removed prop: Layer.dataIterator","depth":4},{"value":"Renamed Props: The ...Scale suffix","depth":4},{"value":"Removed lifecycle method: Layer.willReceiveProps","depth":4},{"value":"Changes to updateTriggers","depth":4},{"value":"AttributeManager changes","depth":3},{"value":"Removed method: AttributeManager.setLogFunctions","depth":4},{"value":"Removed method: AttributeManager.addDynamic","depth":4}],"slug":"docs/upgrade-guide","title":"Upgrade Guide"},{"excerpt":"Roadmap Interested in what is coming down the road? We are trying to make the deck.gl roadmap as public as possible. We are currently using the following ways to share information about the direction of deck.gl. Roadmap Document  - (this document) A high-level summary of our current direction for future releases. Blog  - We use the  vis.gl blog  blog to share information about what we are doing. RFCs  - A wealth of technical detail around planned features is available in our RFCs (Requests For Comments). RFCs are technical writeups that describe a proposed feature. RFCs are available  here . Experimental exports  - We are making unfinished features available as experimental exports. This gives users a clear indication about what is coming and even allow early adopters a chance to play with and provide comments on these features. Experimental Layers  - We are publishing a number of work-in-progress layers to make it easy to experiment with them in applications, see below. Github issues  - As always, github issues are a good way to see what is being discussed and join the discussions. Experimental Layers The  @deck.gl/experimental-layers  is available as of deck.gl v5.2 and contains early versions of future layers. There are a number of interesting layers in this module, however there are caveats: We do not provide website documentation for these layers, so if you want to use these layers you may need to refer directly to the deck.gl source code. While we make reasonable attempts to not break things, we do not guarantee that they will be stable between releases. To prevent surprises, you may want to pin the version of the   @deck.gl/experimental-layers  module in your  package.json . Worst case, if you have to upgrade and some unexpected change happens, you can copy the source code of the affected layer(s) to your app. deck.gl v6.0 These are some of the big priorities for our next release: Aggregation  - Improve and generalize automatic data aggregation (the current HexagonLayer and GridLayer are examples of what to expect). Better Infovis Support  - Better support for non-geospatial visualizations. (Don't worry if you are a geospatial user, deck.gl will remain a \"geospatial-first\" library since that is the more difficult use case.) Better GPGPU/WebGL2 Support  - Many stones are still left unturned here. Expect better performance, and new features for WebGL2 capable browsers (such as animations of entire attributes). Visual Effects  - Shadows, blur, postprocessing etc. This continues to be strong goal that we intend to make progress on. Transitions and Animations  - 5.0 introduces viewport transitions. Expect to see similar support for layer properties and attributes. Viewport transitions feature is available in the  experimental  namespace, and for additional details check the  RFC . deck.gl v5.2 These are some of things we tackled in our most recent release Pure JavaScript Support  - the deck.gl npm module currently has a hard dependency on React, however in v5.0 the internal code is effectively 100% independent of React. We intend to split the library into a core module exposing a \"pure\" JavaScript API and an (optional) module containing the React integration. (Don't worry if you are a React user, deck.gl will continue to be \"React-first\", designed from the ground up with the \"reactive programming paradigm\" in mind. We just want non-React users to also be able use deck.gl). Multi-viewport Support  - Extensive work has been done in v5.0, and we expect to finalize and make much of this functionality official in next release. For now, multiviewport features are available in the  experimental  namespace. For additional details check the  RFCs . Multiple Modules  - In addition, in the future we plan to publish separate modules with deck.gl layers. Code Size  - deck.gl has gone through rapid development and we need to overhaul the code and build processes to reduce the size. Details on Planned Features Controller Support for Multiple Viewports TBA - This is a planned feature for a future release Restrict Event Handling to match Viewport Size  - Controllers need to be able to be restricted to a certain area (in terms of event handling). Some controllers are completely general (just general drag up/down): When working with a map controller, especially panning and zooming, the point under the mouse represents a grab point or a reference for the operation and mapping event coordinates correctly is imporant for the experience. Controllers might not be designed to receive coordinates from outside their viewports. Basically, if the map backing one WebMercator viewport doesn't fill the entire canvas, and the application wants to use a MapControls Controllers will also benefit from be able to feed multiple viewports of different types. There are limits to this of course, in particular it would be nice if for instance a geospatially neabled FirstPerson controller can feed both a  FirstPersonViewport  and a  WebMercatorViewport . Various different viewports must be created from one set of parameters. Contrast this to deck.gl v4.1, where the idea was that each the of Viewport was associated with a specific controller (WebMercatorViewport has a MapController, etc). Using Multiple Controllers  An application having multiple viewports might want to use different interaction in each viewport - this has multiple complications... Switching Controllers  - An application that wants to switch between Viewports might want to switch between controllers, ideally this should not require too much coding effort. Experimental Features in Current Release Multi-Viewport Support Multi-viewport support was added during deck.gl 5.0 development. The APIs are still not considered stable so the related classes are exported as part of the \"experimental\" namespace, and in most cases. deck.gl now allows you to divide your screen into multiple viewports and render your layers from different perspectives, using the experimental  _viewports  property. It is e.g. possible to render a top-down map view next to a first person view for dramatic new perspectives on your data. E.g. an app can allow your users to \"walk around\" in the city onto which its data is overlaid. WebVR Support and Example Multi viewport support can be used to integrate with the WebVR API and create dual WebVR compatible viewports that render a first person view of your data for left and right eye respectively which will display as stereoscopic 3D in supporting hardware. Automatic Positioning of React Children under Viewports In addition, a new  viewId  React property can be added to  DeckGL 's children. This will synchronize the position of the react component with the corresponding deck.gl viewport, which makes it trivial to precisely position e.g. multiple \"base maps\" and other background or foreground HTML components in multi-viewport layouts. The  viewportId  prop also automatically hides the react children when a viewport with the corresponding id is not present or when viewport parameters can not be supported by the underlying map component. Orbit Controller and Orbit Viewport Support TBA All Viewports Now Geospatially Enabled All  Viewport  classes are now geospatially enabled: they now take an optional  longitude / latitude  reference point. In this mode,  position s will be treated as meter offsets from that reference point per  COORDINATE_SYSTEM.METER_OFFSET  conventions. This means that you can now use a FirstPersonViewport (the successor to the  PerspectiveViewport  with layers encoded in  COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNG_LAT  and  COORDINATE_SYSTEM.METER_OFFSETS ) and place a camera anywhere in the scene (in contrast to the  WebMercatorViewport  which only allows you to look \"down\" on a position on the map). Viewports even accept a  modelMatrix  to allow viewport/camera positions to be specified in exactly the same coordinates as  METER_OFFSET  layers, making it possible to place a camera at the exact location any of your existing data points without having to think or do any math.","headings":[{"value":"Roadmap","depth":1},{"value":"Experimental Layers","depth":2},{"value":"deck.gl v6.0","depth":2},{"value":"deck.gl v5.2","depth":2},{"value":"Details on Planned Features","depth":2},{"value":"Controller Support for Multiple Viewports","depth":3},{"value":"Experimental Features in Current Release","depth":2},{"value":"Multi-Viewport Support","depth":3},{"value":"WebVR Support and Example","depth":3},{"value":"Automatic Positioning of React Children under Viewports","depth":3},{"value":"Orbit Controller and Orbit Viewport Support","depth":3},{"value":"All Viewports Now Geospatially Enabled","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/roadmap","title":"Roadmap"},{"excerpt":"Learning Resources API Documentation The documentation for the latest release can be found on deck.gl's  website .

Depending on your tech stack, deck.gl's support for a particular base map solution may come with different level of compatibility and limitations. In this document you will find how to use deck.gl with different providers and technologies. It is important to understand the difference between the JS library rendering and the basemap provider itself. For example you can use MapboxGL with Mapbox basemaps, but also with any other basemap provider that provides Mapbox Vector Tiles. When using different basemaps you have to be sure to follow the terms and conditions of each service and their attribution requirements. Using deck.gl with Mapbox GL JS mapbox-gl  is a powerful open-source map renderer from  Mapbox . deck.gl's  MapView  is designed to sync perfectly with the camera of Mapbox, at every zoom level and rotation angle. When using deck.gl and Mapbox, there are two options you can choose from: Using the Deck canvas as a overlay on top of the Mapbox map, in  pure JS  or  React . This is the most tested and robust use case. Using deck.gl layers as custom Mapbox layers, using the  @deck.gl/mapbox  module. This allows you to interleave deck.gl layers with base map layers, e.g. below text labels or occlude each other correctly in 3D. Be cautious that this feature is experimental: we are working closely with Mapbox to evolve the API. react-map-gl react-map-gl  is a React wrapper around mapbox-gl. If you'd like to use deck.gl with React, this component is the recommended companion. All the  examples on this website  are implemented using the React integration. The  DeckGL  React component works especially well as the parent of a react-map-gl  StaticMap , which automatically interprets the deck.gl view state (i.e. latitude, longitude, zoom etc). In this configuration your deck.gl layers will render as a perfectly synchronized geospatial overlay over the underlying map. Using Mapbox basemap service (with Mapbox token) The mapbox-gl library is open source and free to use. However, to load the map styles and tiles from Mapbox's data service, you will need to register on their website in order to retrieve an  access token  required by the map component, which will be used to identify you and start serving up map tiles. The service will be free until a  certain level  of traffic is exceeded. If you are using mapbox-gl without React, check out  Mapbox GL JS API  for how to apply the token. If you are using react-map-gl, there are several ways to provide a token to your app: Set the  MapboxAccessToken  environment variable. You may need to add additional set up to the bundler ( example ) so that  process.env.MapboxAccessToekn  is accessible at runtime. Provide it in the URL, e.g  ?access_token=TOKEN Pass it as a prop to the ReactMapGL instance  <ReactMapGL mapboxApiAccessToken={TOKEN} /> Using other basemap services It is possible to use the map component without the Mapbox service, you need a URL that conforms to the  Mapbox Style Specification  and pass it to  ReactMapGL  using the  mapStyle  prop. You can use existing free vector tile services: CARTO free basemaps  for non commercial applications. Checkout  this guide  to start using it. Hosting your own basemap service If you host your own map tiles, you will need a custom Mapbox GL style that points to your own  vector tile source , this custom style must match the schema of your tile source. Open source tile schemas include: TileZen schema OpenMapTiles schema  Some useful resources for creating your own map service: Mapbox Vector Tile Spec Open source tools Maputnik Style editor Using deck.gl with Google Maps Starting v7.0, deck.gl has experimental support for Google Maps with the  @deck.gl/google-maps  module. It allows you to construct a Deck instance as a custom Google Maps  OverlayView . The Deck canvas can only be used as a overlay on top of Google Maps, see  pure JS example . Tilting is not supported due to Google Maps API restrictions. See module documentation page for a full list of features. Note that to run the examples, you need a  Google Maps API key .","headings":[{"value":"Using deck.gl with a Base Map","depth":1},{"value":"Using deck.gl with Mapbox GL JS","depth":2},{"value":"react-map-gl","depth":3},{"value":"Using Mapbox basemap service (with Mapbox token)","depth":3},{"value":"Using other basemap services","depth":3},{"value":"Hosting your own basemap service","depth":3},{"value":"Using deck.gl with Google Maps","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/get-started/using-with-map","title":"Using deck.gl with a Base Map"},{"excerpt":"Using deck.gl with React While not directly based on React, deck.gl is designed from ground up to work with  React  based applications. deck.gl layers fit naturally into React's component render flow and flux/redux based appications. deck.gl layers will be performantly rerendered whenever you rerender your normal JSX or React components. The DeckGL React Component To use deck.gl with React, simply import the  DeckGL  React component and render it as a child of another component, passing in your list of deck.gl layers as a property. Adding a Base Map An important companion to deck.gl is  react-map-gl . It is a React wrapper for  Mapbox  that can share the same web mercator viewport settings. Using JSX with deck.gl Layers It is possible to use JSX syntax to create deck.gl layers as React children of the  DeckGL  React components, instead of providing them as ES6 class instances to the  layers  prop. There are no performance advantages to this syntax but it can allow for a more consistent, React-like coding style. For more information on this syntax and its limitations, see  DeckGL API . Using JSX with deck.gl views It is possible to use JSX syntax to create deck.gl views as React children of the  DeckGL  React components, instead of providing them as ES6 class instances to the  views  prop. The following code renders the same set of layers in two viewports, splitting the canvas into two columns: For more information on this syntax, see  DeckGL API . Remarks The  DeckGL  component is typically rendered as a child of a\nmap component like  react-map-gl ,\nbut could be rendered as a child of any React component that you want to\noverlay your layers on top of. To achive the overlay effect, the  DeckGL  component creates a transparent\n canvas  DOM element, into which the deck.gl layers passed in the  layers \nprop will render (using WebGL). Since this canvas is transparent, any\nother component you have underneath (typically a map) will visible behind\nthe layers. When the deck.gl layer list is drawn to screen, it matches the new Layer\ninstances with the instances from the previous render call, intelligently\ncompares the new properties and only updates WebGL state when needed\n(just like React does for DOM components). Internally, the  DeckGL  component initializes a WebGL context\nattached to a canvas element, sets up the animation loop and calls provided\ncallbacks on initial load and for each rendered frame. The  DeckGL \ncomponent also handles events propagation across layers, and prevents\nunnecessary calculations using React and deck.gl lifecycle functions.

For supported layers (look for the 64-bit icon in the docs), 64-bit shaders are used when the  fp64  prop is set to true. With the improved precision 32 bit projection mode in deck.gl 6.1, the use of  fp64  is no longer required to achieve sub-centimeter precision. The new 32 bit projection mode has much better performance. This makes the  fp64  mode more of a niche technology that demonstrates how to use 64 bit calculations should you need to use them in your own applications. Precision With 64-bit floating point support in shader, deck.gl layers is able to visualize data with very high dynamic range. Points covering a whole city and accurate down to sub-centimeter level can be processed and rendered to canvas on-the-fly. Since WebGL does not support 64-bit floating point, deck.gl uses two 32-bit native floating point number to extend and preserve significant digits and uses algorithms similar to those used in many multiple precision math libraries to achieve the precision close to what IEEE-754 double precision floating point numbers provide. Generally speaking, this mechanism provide 46 significant digits in mantissa (48 overall) within the normal range of 32-bit single precision float point numbers. This transfers to ~  1x10^-15  relative error within ~  1.2x10^-38  and  1.7x10^+38 . The error bound as tested on 2015 MacBook Pro with AMD Radeon R9 M370X GPU: Operation Error Addition < 1 ulp Subtraction < 1 ulp Multiplication ~1.5 ulps Division ~2 ulps Square root ~2.6 ulps Exponential ~2.6 ulps Logarithm ~11.6 ulps Trigonometry ~5 ulps Note:  ulp  =  unit of least precision Performance Implications Since the 64-bit floating point maths are emulated using the multiple precision arithmetics, it costs more GPU cycles than native 32-bit\nmath (the shader execution time alone is about 10x slower). However, since 64-bit floating point maths are usually only required in vertex shader, the overall performance impact is usually less than 10x. There will be a memory impact too, in that all vertex attributes and uniform that uses 64-bit maths require double storage space in JavaScript. Same as mentioned above, since a layer usually has some attributes that do not require 64-bit maths, the total memory impact is normally significantly less than 2x. Shaders are more complex and can take time to compile on some systems, notably Windows. For more information regarding the performance of 64-bit layers, please check the performance benchmark layers in the layer-browser example in deck.gl repo. Other Considerations 64-bit shaders push the GPU drivers quite a bit, and workarounds are needed to prevent GPU drivers from optimizing away critical parts of the code. The fp64 shader module has been tested on a range of GPUs and drivers however every now and then we encounter a new driver that needs special treatment. If you mainly deploy into a know set of clients that you can test in advance, this is not a big issue, however if you expect your applications to work across a large set of devices you may want to stay with 32-bit calculations.

This article provides information on current state and some hints about what may come. Binary Data If you plan to work with binary data, you will want to make sure you are up to speed on JavaScript typed arrays as well as GPU buffers, both in terms of general concepts as well as a basic grasp of the API. JavaScript has a number of different ways to represent binary data (Browser  Blob , Node.js Buffers, base64 etc), however deck.gl primarily accepts typed arrays. deck.gl should accept GPU buffers ( WebGLBuffer  or luma.gl  Buffer  instances). CPU vs GPU memory Ultimately all deck.gl rendering is done on the GPU, and all memory must be available to the GPU by being \"uploaded\" into GPU memory  Buffers . By pre-creating GPU buffers and passing these to deck.gl layers you exercise the maximum amount of control of memory management. Note that GPU buffers have many advanced features. They can be interleaved etc. The luma.gl  Accessor  class lets you describe how GPU Buffers should be accessed. Endianness In most cases, when working with binary data, care must be taken to properly define and respect \"endianness\" which essentially describes the order of bytes when larger numbers are stored in memory. However, essentially all of the current web is little endian, so potential big-endian issues are ignored for now. Flattened vs. Nested Data Binary data is flat, whereas JavaScript Arrays can have structure Interleaved Data Binary data can be interleaved. Working directly with interleaved data requires working with  luma.gl  Buffer  instances and attribute accessor objects and is considered an advanced topic. Binary Table Formats deck.gl layers are designed to accept \"tables\" of data as input (the  data  prop). Tables can be organized in several different ways. For binary data you will be working with columnar tables. Row-Based Tables (non-Binary) Row-based tables are the most common and generally the easiest to work with (each row is typically a JavaScript object with fields representing the values of various columns at that row). Columnar Tables Organizing values by column instead of row creates a columnar table. Columnar tables can be significantly more efficient. In particular, because each value is of the same type, columnar tables can be stored as binary data. To use a columnar table as layer data, provide a bundle of typed arrays (a \"vector bundle\"?) as your  data  prop: Chunked Columnar Tables A disadvantage of columnar tables is that columns can get very long, blocking incremental reads/writes of tables and even exceeding platform's allocation limits. More advanced binary columnar table formats like Apache Arrow solves this by breaking logical arrays into chunks. An additional benefit of chunked arrays can support remarkably efficient data-frame operations (slicing/dicing and filtering multi-gigabyte data set with \"zero cost\"). Another complication when using binary columnar tables is that it may not be possible to represent e.g. the lack of a value. In some libraries (e.g. Apache Arrow) this is solved through an additional  null map . Thus, a downside of chunked arrays is that they are complex to work with that they typically require an API (such as Apache Arrow). Chunked Arrow Arrays follows a more complicated relationship with  Vector  instances representing chunks: Table ---* Column (Chunked) ---* Vector Note: These cannot currently be used in deck.gl without pre-concatenating the chunks. There is an RFC (chunked-data-rfc) that would enable chunked data tables (data frames) to be directly consumed by deck.gl (and then sliced and diced at zero cost). Using Binary Data It is sometimes desirable for applications to work directly with binary data and to be able to pass such binary data directly to layers. The motivation is often performance-related but it could just be that the application is able to load data directly in a binary format. Using typed arrays as layer input data  - Using The input data is in binary form, perhaps it is delivered this way from the back-end, and it would be preferable to not have to unpack it. Using typed arrays or GPU buffers directly as layer attributes  - The input data is already formatted in the memory format expected by the GPU and deck.gl's shaders. Using Binary Data directly in GPU The simplest way to supply binary data to deck.gl layers is to override normal attribute calculation and feed in a binary typed array to be used directly as the attribute. This requires that the binary data columns are formatted in exactly the way that the layer expects. This is often fairly straight forward for  fixed primitive layers  but not often practical for  variable primitive layers , as the number of vertices per primitive depends on the details of the tesselation algorithm which can be hard for the data provided to anticipate. Using Binary Data to Calculate Attributes in GPU/GLSL This would mean passing binary data into the vertex shader and there use it to calculate the values the layer needs (colors, elevations etc). This use case would involve writing custom accessor functions. It is currently not directly supported in deck.gl, but could be achieved by creating a custom layer. There are RFCs (glsl accessors, texture attributes) that if implemented, would dramatically improve deck.gl's ability to use provided binary data attributes without pre-processing them in JavaScript. Use Binary Data to Generate Attributes in CPU/JavaScript JavaScript iteration approaches for binary data bundles are under development for v7","headings":[{"value":"Using Binary Data","depth":1},{"value":"Binary Data","depth":2},{"value":"CPU vs GPU memory","depth":3},{"value":"Endianness","depth":3},{"value":"Flattened vs. Nested Data","depth":3},{"value":"Interleaved Data","depth":3},{"value":"Binary Table Formats","depth":2},{"value":"Row-Based Tables (non-Binary)","depth":3},{"value":"Columnar Tables","depth":2},{"value":"Chunked Columnar Tables","depth":2},{"value":"Using Binary Data","depth":2},{"value":"Using Binary Data directly in GPU","depth":2},{"value":"Using Binary Data to Calculate Attributes in GPU/GLSL","depth":2},{"value":"Use Binary Data to Generate Attributes in CPU/JavaScript","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/binary-data","title":"Using Binary Data"},{"excerpt":"Animations and Transitions This document was recently added and is still being finalized deck.gl provides several ways to implement animation and transitions. Camera Transitions  - (aka View State Transitions) when changing the view state, deck.gl can move the camera smoothly between the initial and final view state. Layer Transitions  - (aka Attribute Transitions) Property Animation  - Animation Drawing Constantly vs. When Needed While some 3D applications such as games often keep drawing to screen at a high frame rate, deck.gl avoids this by default. When not animating, deck.gl is optimized to only render to the screen when something changes (a layer's data or props, the viewState etc). This keeps the GPU and CPU load low and minimizes power consumption. However when animating properties, deck.gl needs to update the screen frequently. This does consume more power and can cause fans to spin up etc. However, even when animating deck.gl does not draw to the screen when the application's browser tab is not active. Property Animation Layer properties are divided into two categories. Accessors (that control \"attributes\" and only update when data changes or update triggers fire) and non-accessors that update every time the layer is rendered. Property animation refers to assigning functions as values to non-accessor layer props. The functions will be called every render frame, potentially generating new values every frame at 60 FPS. Advantages of Property Animation While it is certainly possible to implement deck.gl animation by supplying a \"freshly minted\" list of layers to the deck.gl component every frame, e.g. using  Deck.setProps({layers: [new ...Layer(...), ...]}) , this approach has a performance penalty as both your application logic and deck.gl's layer matching system must kick into gear each render frame. By setting property animation functions, properties will be evaluated by the underlying render loop system with considerably less overhead, both deck.gl and your application will essentially remain undisturbed as the layer properties are updated inside a tight inner animation loop. Transitions Transitions in deck.gl are short animations that are triggered when deck.gl detects a change of some property. Instead of immediately redrawing based on the new view value, deck.gl draws a number of frames, automatically interpolating the value over time. View State Transitions View state transitions provide smooth and visually appealing camera transitions when view states change. View state transitions are initiated by updating the  Deck.viewState  prop. Following fields of  viewState  can be used to achieve viewport transitions. transitionDuration  (Number, optional, default: 0) - Transition duration in milliseconds, default value 0, implies no transition. transitionEasing  (Function, optional, default:  t => t ) - Easing function that can be used to achieve effects like \"Ease-In-Cubic\", \"Ease-Out-Cubic\", etc. Default value performs Linear easing. (list of sample easing functions:  http://easings.net/ ) transitionInterpolator  (Object, optional, default:  LinearInterpolator ) - An interpolator object that defines the transition behavior between two viewports, deck.gl provides  LinearInterpolator  and  FlyToInterpolator . Default value,  LinearInterpolator , performs linear interpolation on  ViewState  fields.  FlyToInterpolator  animates  ViewStates  similar to MapBox  flyTo  API and applicable for  MapState , this is pretty useful when camera center changes by long distance. But a user can provide any custom implementation for this object using  TrasitionInterpolator  base class. transitionInterruption  (TRANSITION_EVENTS (Number), optional, default: BREAK) - This field controls how to process a new  ViewState  change that occurs while performing an existing transition. This field has no impact once transition is complete. Here is the list of all possible values with resulting behavior. TRANSITION_EVENTS Result BREAK Current transition will stop at the current state and next  ViewState  update is processed. SNAP_TO_END Current transition will skip remaining transition steps and  ViewState  is updated to final value, transition is stopped and next  ViewState  update is processed. IGNORE Any  ViewState  update is ignored until current transition is complete, this also includes  ViewState  changes due to user interaction. onTransitionStart  (Functional, optional) - Callback fires when requested transition starts. onTransitionInterrupt  (Functional, optional) - Callback fires when transition is interrupted. onTransitionEnd  (Functional, optional) - Callback fires when transition ends. TransitionInterpolators LinearInterpolator  -  Performs linear interpolation between two ViewStates. FlyToInterpolator  - This class is designed to perform  flyTo  style interpolation between two  MapState  objects. TransitionInterpolator  - Base interpolator class that provides common functionality required to interpolate between two ViewState props. This class can be subclassed to implement any custom interpolation: Examples Sample code that provides  flyTo  style transition to move camera from current location to NewYork city. Sample code to get continuous rotations along vertical axis until user interrupts by rotating the map by mouse interaction. It uses  LinearInterpolator  and restricts transitions for  bearing  prop. Continuous transitions are achieved by triggering new transitions using  onTranstionEnd  callback.","headings":[{"value":"Animations and Transitions","depth":1},{"value":"Animation","depth":2},{"value":"Drawing Constantly vs. When Needed","depth":3},{"value":"Property Animation","depth":3},{"value":"Advantages of Property Animation","depth":3},{"value":"Transitions","depth":2},{"value":"View State Transitions","depth":3},{"value":"TransitionInterpolators","depth":3},{"value":"Examples","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/animations-and-transitions","title":"Animations and Transitions"},{"excerpt":"Building Apps This article contains additional information on options for how to build deck.gl. Optimizing for Bundle Size deck.gl and luma.gl provide a lot of functionality and the amount of code these libraries contain will of course impact the size of your application bundle and your startup load time. There are multiple techniques used in JavaScript. Choosing a dist folder When installed from npm, deck.gl and related libraries come with three separate  dist  sub folders. Folder mainField Description dist/es5 main All code is transpiled into ES5 and exports/imports are transpiled into  commonjs  requires. The main reason to use this distribution is if your bundler does not support tree-shaking using  import / export dist/esm module Same as  dist/es5 , except  export  and  import  statements are left untranspiled to enable tree shaking. dist/es6 esnext This distribution uses  babel-preset-env  and with very few exceptions essentially untranspiled ES6/ES2015 code. This is the smallest distribution, that will three-shake best, and is intended to be the best choice if you are only targeting \"evergreen\" browsers. You will have to check the documentation of your particular bundler to see what configuration options are available: Webpack 4 allows you to choose the  esnext  distribution by specifying a  resolve.mainFields  array. Webpack 2 and later will pick  module  main field over  main  if it is available. For other bundlers, please refer to the respective documentation. About Tree-Shaking deck.gl was designed from the start to leverage tree-shaking. This technique has been talked about for quite some time but has been slow in actually providing the expected benefits. With the combination of webpack 4 and babel 7 we are finally starting to see significant results, so you may want to experiment with upgrading your bundler if you are not getting results. Note that tree-shaking still has limitations: At least in webpack, tree shaking is done by the uglifier, which is typically only run on production builds, so it is typically not possible to assess the benefits of tree shaking during development. In addition, this makes it even harder to make statements about bundle size impact from looking at bundle sizes in development builds. The recommendation is to always measure impact on your final production builds. Static dependency analyzers err on the side of safety and will still include any symbol it is not sure will never be used. This is compounded by the fact that there are side effects in various language feature that complicate or defeat current static dependency analysis techniques, causing \"dead code\" to still be bundled. The good news is that the analyzers are getting better. Naturally, an application that uses all the functionality offered by the library will benefit little from tree shaking, whereas a small app that only uses a few layers should expect bigger savings. Bundle Size Number So, what bundle size impact should you expect? When do you know if you have set up your bundler optimally. To help answer these questions, we provide some numbers you can compare against. deck.gl has scripts that measure the size of a minified bundle after each build, which allows us to provide comparison numbers between releases. Dist 6.0 Bundle (Compressed) 5.2 Bundle (Compr.) 5.1 Bundle (Compr.) Comments ES6 530 KB (142 KB) 527 KB (141 KB) N/A Minimally transpiled, almost \"pure\" ES6 ESM 633 KB (153 KB) 715 KB (159 KB) 708 KB (169 KB) Transpiled, tree-shaking enabled ES5 695 KB (167 KB) 748 KB (166 KB) 754 KB (176 KB) Transpiled to ES5, no tree-shaking Notes: Numbers represent the minified bundle size of a minimal application, bundled with Webpack 4, which means that the ES6 and ESM distribution results benefit from some tree shaking. The number in parenthesis is the compressed bundle size. This is how much bigger you might expect your compressed bundle to get by adding deck.gl as a dependency to your application. Future Work This is not the final word on deck.gl bundle size. More work is being done to reduce the size of deck.gl and we are confident that even as future releases will have more functionality, we will be able to keep the library code from growing and, more importantly, make deck.gl even more \"tree shakeable\", with the intention that apps should only \"pay for what they use\". Remarks Optimizing for minified code  - Due to inclusion of sourcemaps etc, the bundle size impact of deck.gl tends to look more significant in development builds than in the final production builds. While reducing the size of the development libraries is also desirable, the current goal is to ensure the impact of adding deck.gl on the final, minified/uglified application bundle is as small as possible. Compressed bundle sizes are calculated using  gzip -9 . Consider using slower  brotli  compression for static assets, it typically provides an additional 20% reduction.","headings":[{"value":"Building Apps","depth":1},{"value":"Optimizing for Bundle Size","depth":2},{"value":"Choosing a dist folder","depth":3},{"value":"About Tree-Shaking","depth":3},{"value":"Bundle Size Number","depth":3},{"value":"Future Work","depth":3},{"value":"Remarks","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/building-apps","title":"Building Apps"},{"excerpt":"Controllers This page is a placeholder deck.gl supports several models of event handling and viewport controls Viewport Controls States ...

Positions are expected to be supplied as two or three element arrays ( [x, y]  or  [x, y, z] ). Objects can also have  dimensions  (e.g. the radius of a circle, the width of a path, etc), most of which are specified as a single number. Positions and dimensions are used to construct a 3D world with your data. By default, deck.gl layers interprets positions as geospatial coordinates (i.e.  [longitude, latitude, altitude] ), and dimensions as in meters. So when working with geospatial data sources such as GeoJSON, deck.gl will automatically interpret any positions correctly. deck.gl also supports a selection of alternative coordinate systems, supporting data from e.g. LIDAR sensors, and non-geospatial use cases. Each deck.gl layer can define its own coordinate system. Within the data supplied to a single layer, all positions must be specified in the same coordinate system. Layers using different coordinate systems can be composed together, which is very useful when dealing with datasets from different sources. Supported Coordinate Systems Coordinate System Mode Positions Dimensions Notes COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT  (default) longitude, latitude, altitude meters Longitude and latitude are specified as  WGS84  coordinates in degrees from Greenwich meridian / equator respectively, and altitude is specified in meters above sea level. COORDINATE_SYSTEM.METER_OFFSETS  * Δx, Δy, Δz meters Positions are given in meter offsets from a reference geo-location that is specified separately ( coordinateOrigin ). The  x  axis points map east, the  y  axis points map north, and  z  points up. COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT_OFFSETS Δlongitude, Δlatitude, Δaltitude meters Positions are given in meter offsets from a reference geo-location that is specified separately ( coordinateOrigin ). COORDINATE_SYSTEM.CARTESIAN x, y, z identity units A linear system with no interpretation for pure info-vis layers. Viewports can be used without supplying geospatial reference points. COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT_DEPRECATED longitude, latitude, altitude meters A lower precision version of the  COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT  mode, that was the default until deck.gl v6.2. Will be removed in a future release. Note that although UTM ( Universal Transverse Mercator ) coordinates uses similar meter offsets as the deck.gl meters mode, be aware there are subtle differences, so be careful before making assumptions. Choosing the Right Coordinate System The choice of coordinate system is often dictated by your data. Generally speaking, converting data from one coordinate system to another on the CPU is costly and should be avoided, especially when dealing with spherical coordinates. Whether your data comes in  lng / lat s or meter offsets, the best choice is to just configure any deck.gl layers displaying that data to use the corresponding  coordinateSystem . Coordinate systems can be specified per layer, meaning that each layer can have data with positions specified in a different coordinate system. If configurated correctly, they can all be rendered aligned at the same time. An example of a use case where different coordinate systems are combined: Render a layer showing 3D buildings could have vertices specified in longitudes and latitudes (simply because available building data sources tend to be encoded this way) Render layer showing cars or pedestrians moving between the buildings with all positions specified using meter offsets from an anchor point somewhere in the city (e.g. the position of a sensor, in longitude and latitude), because meter offsets are more natural encoding for this data. Limitations of the Offset Systems Like most cartographic projections, the  Web Mercator projection  is non-linear. The offset system trades accuracy for performance by approximating the projection with a linearized local projection system. When working on local scales, small cities etc, using meter offsets gives a  very high degree of precision . When visualizing data on large scales (countries and continents) results will only be correct if you specify longitude and latitude for every point. Transforming Positions and Dimensions Raw data do not always align cleanly with one of the provided coordinate systems. Here are some examples: Instead of meters, offsets and dimensions may come in millimeters, feet or miles. Instead of  x  aligning with map east and  y  aligning with map north, the offsets may be measured by a device with dynamic orientation. This is common in use cases such as a LIDAR scanner mounted on a moving vehicle. Again, converting raw data to match the coordinate system expectations can be very expensive if done on the CPU. This should be avoided whenever possible. Instead, in addition to specifying  coordinateSystem: COORDINATE_SYSTEM.METER_OFFSETS  and  coordinateOrigin , a layer could also specify the  modelMatrix  prop as a 4x4 transformation matrix. The  math.gl  library (a light wrapper of  gl-matrix ) can be used for this purpose, which is already a dependency of deck.gl. The  modelMatrix  prop is most useful with the  METER_OFFSETS  and  IDENTITY  coordinate systems. It is usually the right solution for pre-processing (flipping, rotating, scaling etc) your data, since these operations will be done very performantly in the GPU. Note that these two coordinate systems are the only ones that are linear and uniform in all directions. Longitude and latitude based positions cannot be scaled/rotated/translated correctly with a 4x4 matrix. Also note that  modelMatrix  only applies to positions. To transform the dimensions for each object, most layers provide props such as  radiusScale ,  widthScale ,  sizeScale  etc. Check each layer's documentation for what's available. Views and Projections The same positions can be drawn differently to screen based on what projection method is used. deck.gl's  views  define how the camera should be set up to look at your data objects. View states, such as zoom level, center point, pitch and bearing affect where things are drawn on the screen. The view is independent of the layers' coordinate systems, and is shared by all layers. So all layers will always pan, zoom and tilt together, regardless of what coordinate system their positions are specified in. The default view used in deck.gl is the  MapView , which implements the  Web Mercator projection . When working with non-geospatial datasets, the  IDENTITY  coordinate system needs to be used in combination with an alternative view. Read about deck.gl's view system in  Views and Projections . Comparison to Standard 3D Graphics Coordinate Systems There can be some confusion when mapping between deck.gl's coordinate systems and those typically seen in 3D graphics applications, i.e. model space, world space, view space, clip space. deck.gl's world space maps to the standard \"model space\", i.e. the data that comes in before any transforms have been applied. deck.gl's common space plays the role of standard \"world space\", but there are a few important differences. The y axis is inverted, which  means it's a left-handed coordinate system. The mercator \"zoom\" factor is applied as a common space transform (rather than in the view or projection transforms). The view transform in deck.gl includes a scaling of the z axis by 1 / height of the screen in pixel. This is done to line up mercator pixels with screen pixels, but also means the \"near\" and \"far\" distances used in the perspective transform are not the true distances, but numbers scaled down by the same factor.","headings":[{"value":"Coordinate Systems","depth":1},{"value":"Supported Coordinate Systems","depth":2},{"value":"Choosing the Right Coordinate System","depth":2},{"value":"Limitations of the Offset Systems","depth":3},{"value":"Transforming Positions and Dimensions","depth":2},{"value":"Views and Projections","depth":2},{"value":"Comparison to Standard 3D Graphics Coordinate Systems","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/coordinate-systems","title":"Coordinate Systems"},{"excerpt":"Debugging deck.gl provides support for debugging applications and layers, which includes: deck.gl logging luma.gl debugging support deck.gl logging deck.gl (and luma.gl) are based on the probe.gl debugging library, providing user configurable console logging with advanced functions like the ability to log images and tables etc to the console.

To enable debug logging simply issue the following commands in your browser console: The following features are available: Automatic sanity checks are performed on uniforms and attributes. Passing an  undefined  value to a uniform is a common JavaScript mistake that will immediately generate a descriptive exception in deck.gl. This can be tracked from the console output. The  Deck  class and  DeckGL  react component have a debug flag which instructs luma.gl to instruments the gl context (with a performance cost) which allows tracing all WebGL call errors, see below on luma debug log levels. It also generates exceptions immediately when a WebGL operation fails, allowing you to pinpoint exactly where in the code the issue happened. Due to the asynchronous nature of the GPU, some WebGL execution errors are surfaced and caught later than the calls that generate them.

It is also available for those who need to test their own custom layers and/or deck.gl applications. Unit Tests for deck.gl Layers Lifecycle test functions are designed to allow for integration with different unit test frameworks.

The easiest way to enable pan/zoom/rotate of the visualization is to set the  controller  prop on  Deck  or  <DeckGL>  to  true  along with an  initialViewState  object that defines the initial camera settings: You can also selectively enable/disable certain controller features: See  Controller  for all options. Reset Camera Position An application can reset the camera state by supplying a new  initialViewState  object at any time: To add a transition animation, see  view state transitions . Add Constraints to View State An application can optionally supply the  onViewStateChange  callback and manipulate the view state before it is used. The following example constrains the map in a bounding box: Externally Manage View State For more flexibility you can maintain the view state yourself and pass it in to deck.gl via the  viewState  parameter. This essentially makes  Deck / <DeckGL>  a stateless component, and allows you to share the view state between multiple components, e.g. via a Redux store. Note: Do not combine  initialViewState  and  viewState  props.  viewState  will always overwrite any internal state. The following example demonstrates how to do this with React: Advanced View Controls Alternative views such as OrbitView, FirstPersonView, and using multiple views such as VR, minimap:  Views and Projections Implement a custom controller:  Controller Picking deck.gl includes a powerful picking engine that enables the application to precisely determine what object and layer is rendered on a certain pixel on the screen. This picking engine can either be called directly by an application (which is then typically implementing its own event handling), or it can be called automatically by the basic built-in event handling in deck.gl What can be Picked? The \"picking engine\" identifies which object in which layer is at the given coordinates. While usually intuitive, what constitutes a pickable \"object\" is defined by each layer. Typically, it corresponds to one of the data entries that is passed in via  prop.data . For example, in  Scatterplot Layer , an object is an element in the  props.data  array that is used to render one circle. In  GeoJson Layer , an object is a GeoJSON feature in the  props.data  feature collection that is used to render one point, path or polygon. Enabling Picking Picking can be enabled or disabled on a layer-by-layer basis. To enable picking on a layer, set its  pickable  prop to  true . This value is  false  by default. The Picking Info Object The picking engine returns \"picking info\" objects which contains a variety of fields describing what layer and object was picked. Key Value layer The layer that the picked object belongs to. Only layers with the  pickable  prop set to true can be picked. index The index of the object in the layer that was picked. object The object that was picked. This is typically an entry in the layer's  props.data  array, but can vary from layer to layer. x Mouse position x relative to the viewport. y Mouse position y relative to the viewport. coordinate Mouse position in geospatial coordinates. Only applies if  layer.props.coordinateSystem  is a geospatial mode such as  COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT . Specific deck.gl Layers may add additional fields to the picking  info  object. Check the documentation of each layer. Example: Display a Tooltip for Hovered Object Using the Built-In Tooltip Deck  automatically renders a tooltip if the  getTooltip  callback is supplied: It receives a picking info object and returns the content of the tooltip. To custom the tooltip further, return an object instead: For a range of options, see  getTooltip  documentation. Using React Calling the Picking Engine Directly The picking engine is exposed through the  Deck.pickObject  and  Deck.pickObjects  methods. These methods allow you to query what layers and objects within those layers are under a specific point or within a specified rectangle. They return  Picking Info  objects as described below. pickObject  allows an application to define its own event handling. When it comes to how to actually do event handling in a browser, there are many options. In a React application, perhaps the simplest is to just use React's \"synthetic\" event handling together with  pickObject : Also note that by directly calling  queryObject , integrating deck.gl into an existing application often becomes easier since you don't have to change the application's existing approach to event handling. Under The Hood If you are using the core layers, all has been taken care of. If you are implementing a custom layer, read more about\n how picking is implemented . Built-in Events For applications that have basic event handling needs, deck.gl has built-in support for handling selected pointer events. When the application registers callbacks, deck.gl automatically tracks these events, runs the picking engine and calls application callbacks with a single parameter  info  which contains the resulting picking info object. The following event handlers are supported: onHover onClick onDragStart onDrag onDragEnd A event handler function is called with two parameters:  info  that contains the object being interacted with, and  event  that contains the pointer event. There are two ways to subscribe to the built-in picking event handling: Specify callbacks for each pickable layer by passing  event handler props : Specify callbacks for all pickable layers by setting  event handler props  of the  DeckGL  canvas: Behavior of Built-in Event Handling Picking events are triggered based on  pickable objects : A  click  event is triggered every time the pointer clicked on an object in a pickable layer. A  hover  event is triggered every time the hovered object of a pickable layer changes. When an event is fired, the  onHover  or  onClick  callback of the affected layer is called first. If the callback returns a truthy value, the event is marked as handled. Otherwise, the event will bubble up to the  DeckGL  canvas and be visible to its  onHover  and  onClick  callbacks.","headings":[{"value":"Adding Interactivity","depth":1},{"value":"Controlling the Camera","depth":2},{"value":"Reset Camera Position","depth":3},{"value":"Add Constraints to View State","depth":3},{"value":"Externally Manage View State","depth":3},{"value":"Advanced View Controls","depth":3},{"value":"Picking","depth":2},{"value":"What can be Picked?","depth":3},{"value":"Enabling Picking","depth":3},{"value":"The Picking Info Object","depth":3},{"value":"Example: Display a Tooltip for Hovered Object","depth":3},{"value":"Using the Built-In Tooltip","depth":4},{"value":"Using React","depth":4},{"value":"Calling the Picking Engine Directly","depth":3},{"value":"Under The Hood","depth":3},{"value":"Built-in Events","depth":2},{"value":"Behavior of Built-in Event Handling","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/interactivity","title":"Adding Interactivity"},{"excerpt":"Tips and Tricks Rendering Tips Per Layer Control of WebGL parameters The base  Layer  class (which is inherited by all layers) supports a  parameters  property that allows applications to specify the state of WebGL parameters such as blending mode, depth testing etc. This can provide signigicant extra control over rendering. The new  parameters  prop leverages the luma.gl v4  setParameters  API, which allows all WebGL parameters to be specified as keys in a single parameter object. z-fighting and Depth Testing A common problem faced by 3D application developers is known as \"z fighting\". It relates to multiple objects being drawn at the same depth in the 3D scene, and due to rounding artifacts in the so called z buffer the GPU cannot accurately determine whether a pixel has already been drawn in a specific place. If you are not using 3D extrusions, the easiest way to get rid of z fighting is typically just to turn off depth testing. It can be done globally or per-layer. Also, if the z-fighting occurs between layers (rather than between elements within a single layers), deck.gl offers a slightly more sophisticated  polygonOffset  property. Browser Blending Modes Occasionally, the default blending in the browser does not give ideal results. In that case you may want to test the tips in this section. To understand why browser blending modes can matter, consider that deck.gl renders in a separate transparent div on top of the map div, so the final composition of the image a user see on the monitor is controlled by the browser according to CSS settings instead of the WebGL settings. One way to control this blending effect is by specifying the CSS property  mix-blend-mode  in modern browsers to be  multiply : multiply  blend mode usually gives the expected results, as it only darkens. This blend mode keeps the overlay colors, but lets map legends underneath remain black and legible. Note:  that there is a caveat with setting  mix-blend-mode , as it can affect other peer HTML elements, especially other map children (perhaps controls or legends that are being rendered on top of the map).\nIf this is an issue, set the  isolation  CSS prop on the  DeckGL  parent element. Optimization for Mobile Experimental Memory Usage Controls The  Deck  class supports the following experimental props to aggressively reduce memory usage on memory-restricted devices: _pickable  (Boolean) Default  true If set to  false , force disables all picking features (overrides  layer.props.pickable ). _typedArrayManagerProps  (Object) overAlloc  (Number) - Default  2 . By default, attributes are allocated twice the memory than they actually need (on both CPU and GPU). Must be larger than  1 . poolSize  (Number) - Default  100 . When memory reallocation is needed, old chunks are held on to and recycled. Smaller number uses less CPU memory. Can be any number  >=0 . The above default settings make data updates faster, at the price of using more memory. If the app does not anticipate frequent data changes, they may be aggressively reduced:","headings":[{"value":"Tips and Tricks","depth":1},{"value":"Rendering Tips","depth":2},{"value":"Per Layer Control of WebGL parameters","depth":2},{"value":"z-fighting and Depth Testing","depth":2},{"value":"Browser Blending Modes","depth":2},{"value":"Optimization for Mobile","depth":2},{"value":"Experimental Memory Usage Controls","depth":3},{"value":"_pickable (Boolean)","depth":5},{"value":"_typedArrayManagerProps (Object)","depth":5}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/tips-and-tricks","title":"Tips and Tricks"},{"excerpt":"Performance Optimization General Performance Expectations There are mainly two aspects that developers usually consider regarding the\nperformance of any computer programs: the time and the memory consumption, both of which obviously depends on the specs of the hardware deck.gl is ultimately running on. On 2015 MacBook Pros with dual graphics cards, most basic layers\n(like  ScatterplotLayer ) renders fluidly at 60 FPS during pan and zoom\noperations up to about 1M (one million) data items, with framerates dropping into low double digits (10-20FPS) when the data sets approach 10M items. Even if interactivity is not an issue, browser limitations on how big chunks of contiguous memory can be allocated (e.g. Chrome caps individual allocations at 1GB) will cause most layers to crash during WebGL buffer generation somewhere between 10M and 100M items. You would need to break up your data into chunks and use multiple deck.gl layers to get past this limit. Modern phones (recent iPhones and higher-end Android phones) are surprisingly capable in terms of rendering performance, but are considerably more sensitive to memory pressure than laptops, resulting in browser restarts or page reloads. They also tend to load data significantly slower than desktop computers, so some tuning is usually needed to ensure a good overall user experience on mobile. Layer Update Performance Layer update happens when the layer is first created, or when some layer props change. During an update, deck.gl may load necessary resources (e.g. image textures), generate WebGL buffers, and upload them to the GPU, all of which may take some time to complete, depending on the number of items in your  data  prop. Therefore, the key to performant deck.gl applications is to minimize layer updates wherever possible. Minimize data changes When the  data  prop changes, the layer will recalculate all of its WebGL buffers. The time required for this is proportional to the number of items in your\n data  prop.\nThis step is the most expensive operation that a layer does - also on CPU - potentially affecting the responsiveness of the application. It may take\nmultiple seconds for multi-million item layers, and if your  data  prop is updated\nfrequently (e.g. animations), \"stutter\" can be visible even for layers with just a few thousand items. Some good places to check for performance improvements are: Avoid unnecessary shallow change in data prop   The layer does a shallow comparison between renders to determine if it needs to regenerate buffers. If\n  nothing has changed, make sure you supply the  same  data object every time you render. If the data object has to change shallowly for some reason, consider using the  dataComparator  prop to supply a custom comparison logic. Use updateTriggers   So  data  has indeed changed. Do we have an entirely new collection of objects? Or did just certain fields changed in each row? Remember that changing  data  will update  all  buffers, so if, for example, object positions have not changed, it will be a waste of time to recalculate them.   In this case, it is more efficient to use  updateTriggers  to invalidate only the selected attributes: Handle incremental data loading   A common technique for handling big datasets on the client side is to load data in chunks. We want to update the visualization whenever a new chunk comes in. If we append the new chunk to an existing data array, deck.gl will recalculate the whole buffers, even for the previously loaded chunks where nothing have changed:   To avoid doing this, we instead generate one layer for each chunk:   Starting v7.2.0, support for async iterables is added to efficiently update layers with incrementally loaded data:   See  Layer properties  for details. Favor layer visibility over addition and removal   Removing a layer will lose all of its internal states, including generated buffers. If the layer is added back later, all the WebGL resources need to be regenerated again. In the use cases where layers need to be toggled frequently (e.g. via a control panel), there might be a significant perf penalty:   The  visible  prop is a cheap way to temporarily disable a layer: Optimize Accessors 99% of the CPU time that deck.gl spends in updating buffers is calling the accessors you supply to the layer. Since they are called on every data object, any performance issue in the accessors is amplified by the size of your data. Favor constants over callback functions   Most accessors accept constant values as well as functions. Constant props are extremely cheap to update in comparison. Use  ScatterplotLayer  as an example, the following two prop settings yield exactly the same visual outcome: getFillColor: [255, 0, 0, 128]  - deck.gl uploads 4 numbers to the GPU. getFillColor: d => [255, 0, 0, 128]  - deck.gl first builds a typed array of  4 * data.length  elements, call the accessor  data.length  times to fill it, then upload it to the GPU. Aside from accessors, most layers also offer one or more  *Scale  props that are uniform multipliers on top of the per-object value. Always consider using them before invoking the accessors: Use trivial functions as accessors   Whenever possible, make the accessors trivial functions and utilize pre-defined and/or pre-computed data. Use Binary Data When creating data-intensive applications, it is often desirable to offload client-side data processing to the server or web workers. The server can send data to the client more efficiently using binary formats, e.g.  protobuf ,  Arrow  or simply a custom binary blob. Some deck.gl applications use web workers to load data and generate attributes to get the processing off the main thread. Modern worker implementations allow ownership of typed arrays to be  transferred directly  between threads at virtually no cost, bypassing serialization and deserialization of JSON objects. Supply binary blobs to the data prop   Assume we have the data source encoded in the following format:   Upon receiving the typed arrays, the application can of course re-construct a classic JavaScript array:   However, in addition to requiring custom repacking code, this array will take valuable CPU time to create, and significantly more memory to store than its binary form. In performance-sensitive applications that constantly push a large volume of data (e.g. animations), this method will not be efficient enough.   Alternatively, one may supply a non-iterable object (not Array or TypedArray) to the  data  object. In this case, it must contain a  length  field that specifies the total number of objects. Since  data  is not iterable, each accessor will not receive a valid  object  argument, and therefore responsible of interpreting the input data's buffer layout:   Optionally, the accessors can utilize the pre-allocated  target  array in the second argument to further avoid creating new objects: Supply attributes directly   While the built-in attribute generation functionality is a major part of a  Layer s functionality, it can become a major bottleneck in performance since it is done on CPU in the main thread. If the application needs to push many data changes frequently, for example to render animations, data updates can block rendering and user interaction. In this case, the application should consider precalculated attributes on the back end or in web workers.    Deck.gl layers accepts external attributes as either a typed array or a WebGL buffer. Such attributes, if prepared carefully, can be directly utilized by the GPU, thus bypassing the CPU-bound attribute generation completely.   This technique offers the maximum performance possible in terms of data throughput, and is commonly used in heavy-duty, performance-sensitive applications.   To generate an attribute buffer for a layer, take the results returned from each object by the  get*  accessors and flatten them into a typed array. For example, consider the following layers:   Should we move the attribute generation to a web worker:   Note that instead of  getPosition , we supply a  data.attributes.getPosition  object. This object defines the buffer from which  PointCloudLayer  should access its positions data. See the base  Layer  class'  data prop  for details.   It is also possible to use interleaved or custom layout external buffers:   See full example in  examples/experimental/interleaved-buffer .   Note that external attributes only work with primitive layers, not composite layers, because composite layers often need to preprocess the data before passing it to the sub layers. Some layers that deal with variable-width data, such as  PathLayer ,  SolidPolygonLayer , require additional information passed along with  data.attributes . Consult each layer's documentation before use. Layer Rendering Performance Layer rendering time (for large data sets) is essentially proportional to: The number of vertex shader invocations,\nwhich corresponds to the number of items in the layer's  data  prop The number of fragment shader invocations, which corresponds to the total\nnumber of pixels drawn. Thus it is possible to render a scatterplot layer with 10M items with reasonable\nframe rates on recent GPUs, provided that the radius (number of pixels) of each\npoint is small. It is good to be aware that excessive overdraw (drawing many objects/pixels on top of each other) can generate very high fragment counts and thus hurt performance. As an example, a  Scatterplot  radius of 5 pixels generates ~ 100 pixels per point. If you have a  Scatterplot  layer with 10 million points, this can result in up to 1 billion fragment shader invocations per frame. While dependent on zoom levels (clipping will improve performance to some extent) this many fragments will certainly strain even a recent MacBook Pro GPU. Layer Picking Performance deck.gl performs picking by drawing the layer into an off screen picking buffer. This essentially means that every layer that supports picking will be drawn off screen when panning and hovering. The picking is performed using the same GPU code that does the visual rendering, so the performance should be easy to predict. Picking limitations: The picking system can only distinguish between 16M items per layer. The picking system can only handle 256 layers with the pickable flag set to true. Number of Layers The layer count of an advanced deck.gl application tends to gradually increase, especially when using composite layers. We have built and optimized a highly complex application using close to 100 deck.gl layers (this includes hierarchies of sublayers rendered by custom composite layers rendering other composite layers) without seeing any performance issues related to the number of layers. If you really need to, it is probably possible to go a little higher (a few hundred layers). Just keep in mind that deck.gl was not designed to be used with thousands of layers. Common Issues A couple of particular things to watch out for that tend to have a big impact on performance: If not needed disable Retina/High DPI rendering. It generates 4x the number of pixels (fragments) and can have a big performance impact that depends on which computer or monitor is being used. This feature can be controlled using  useDevicePixels  prop of  DeckGL  component and it is on by default. Avoid using luma.gl debug mode in production. It queries the GPU error status after each operation which has a big impact on performance. Smaller considerations: Enabling picking can have a small performance penalty so make sure the  pickable  property is  false  in layers that do not need picking (this is the default value).","headings":[{"value":"Performance Optimization","depth":1},{"value":"General Performance Expectations","depth":2},{"value":"Layer Update Performance","depth":2},{"value":"Minimize data changes","depth":3},{"value":"Avoid unnecessary shallow change in data prop","depth":4},{"value":"Use updateTriggers","depth":4},{"value":"Handle incremental data loading","depth":4},{"value":"Favor layer visibility over addition and removal","depth":4},{"value":"Optimize Accessors","depth":3},{"value":"Favor constants over callback functions","depth":4},{"value":"Use trivial functions as accessors","depth":4},{"value":"Use Binary Data","depth":3},{"value":"Supply binary blobs to the data prop","depth":4},{"value":"Supply attributes directly","depth":4},{"value":"Layer Rendering Performance","depth":2},{"value":"Layer Picking Performance","depth":2},{"value":"Number of Layers","depth":2},{"value":"Common Issues","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/performance","title":"Performance Optimization"},{"excerpt":"Using Layers The \"Layer\" is a core concept of deck.gl. A deck.gl layer is a packaged visualization type that takes a collection of datums, associate each with positions, colors, extrusions, etc., and renders them on a map. deck.gl provides an extensive  layer catalog  and is designed to compose many layers together to form complex visuals. Constructing a Layer Instance A layer is instantiated with a  properties  object: The  properties  are settings that the layer uses to build the visualization. Users of a layer typically specify the following types of props: Layer ID The  id  prop is the unique identifier of this layer among all layers. Constructing a new layer instance in its own does not have any performance impact, as deck.gl only does the expensive calculations when a layer is  created  (an id appearing for the first time) or  updated  (different props are passed in for the same id). Read more about this in  layer lifecycle . It is recommend that this prop is set explicitly to avoid collision. Data The  data  prop specifies data source of this layer's visualization. The value is expected to be a collection (typically a JavaScript array) of data objects with similar structure, such as rows in a table. deck.gl layers are able to handle millions of data objects very efficiently. The value of this prop can be  Array ,  Map ,  Set , any object that contains a  length  field, a  Promise  that resolves to any of the above, or an URL to a JSON array. See  data prop  documentation for details. Accessors An accessor is a prop that maps an object in  data  to its visual configuration, e.g. the radius of a circle, the color of a line, etc. All accessor prop names start with  get . If an accessor prop is set to a function, when the layer is about to be drawn on screen for the first time, the layer will traverse the  data  stream and call the accessor function with each element. The accessor function receives two arguments: object  - the current element in the data stream. If  data  is an array or an iterable, the element of the current iteration is used. If  data  is a non-iterable object, this argument is always  null . objectInfo  (Object) - contextual information of the current element. Contains the following fields: index  (Number) - the index of the current iteration data  - the value of the  data  prop target  (Array) - a pre-allocated array. The accessor function can optionally fill data into this array and return it, instead of creating a new array for every object. In some browsers this improves performance significantly by reducing garbage collection. The accessor function is typically expected to return either a number or an array. Some accessors also support constant values instead of functions. When a constant value is provided, it is applied to all objects in the data stream. Unlike a functional value, which is called once for every data object to fill a WebGL buffer proportional to the data size, constant accessors have CPU and memory cost of  O(1)  and are much more performant. Other Layer Props The rest of the props are typically numeric or boolean values that apply to the whole layer. These include props that define the render options (opacity, extrusion of the PolygonLayer, font family of the TextLayer, etc.),  coordinate system , and  interactivity . Rendering Layers deck.gl allows you to render multiple layers using the same or different data sets. You simply provide an array of layer instances and deck.gl will render them in order (and handle interactivity when hovering clicking etc). This allows you to compose visualizations using several primitive layers. FAQ Should I be Creating New Layers on Every Render? The Reactive Programming Paradigm deck.gl's architecture is based on the reactive programming paradigm: In a reactive application, a complete UI description is \"re-rendered\" every time something in the application state changes (in the case of a deck.gl application, a new list of layers is created whenever something changes). The UI framework (in this case, deck.gl) makes the choices about what to update, by comparing (or \"diffing\") the newly rendered UI description with the last rendered UI description. The framework then the makes minimal necessary changes to account for the differences, and then redraws. The required changes are made to \"WebGL state\" in case of deck.gl, and to the Browser's DOM (HTML element tree) in case of React. Creating Layer Instances Is Cheap The deck.gl model means that applications are expected to create a new set of layers every time application state changes, which can seem surprisingly inefficient to someone who hasn't done reactive programming before. The trick is that layers are just descriptor objects that are very cheap to instantiate, and internally, the new layers are efficiently matched against existing layers so that no updates are performed unless actually needed. So, even though the application creates new \"layers\", those layers are only \"descriptors\" containing props that specify what needs to be rendered and how. All calculated state (WebGL \"programs\", \"vertex attributes\" etc) are stored in a state object and this state object is moved forward to the newly matched layer on every render cycle.  The new layer ends up with the state of the old layer (and the props of the new layer), while the old layer is simply discarded for garbage collection. The application does not have to be aware about this, as long as it keeps rendering new layers with the same  id  they will be matched and the existing state of that layer will be updated accordingly. The constant creation and disposal of layer instances may seem wasteful, however the creation and recycling of JavaScript objects is quite efficient in modern JavaScript environments, and this is very similar to how React works where every render cycle generates a new tree of ReactElement instances, so the model is proven. For more details on layer creation, update and destruction, read about  Layer Lifecycle . Why Doesn't My Layer Update with New Props? Since the reactive programming frameworks conceptually render the entire UI every render cycle, and achieves efficiency by comparing and \"diffing\" changes between render cycles, it is important that comparisons are fast. Because of this, deck.gl uses shallow equality as the default comparison method for most props. An exception is the accessors. Changing the value of an accessor (i.e. supplying a different function to the accessor prop) will not in itself trigger an attribute update. This is because the function identity is a poor indicator of whether an update is needed, and the convenience of using local functions as prop values. Consider the code below,  getRadius  is shallowly changed every time  render()  is called, even if its execution result would not change: In another example,  getColor  is shallowly changed, so would its execution result: There is no way for deck.gl to know what the programmer intended just by looking at or comparing the functions that are supplied to a  Layer s accessor props. Because recalculating attributes can be potentially expensive, deck.gl by default ignores shallow changes in accessor props. This is designed to provide the best performance to the most common use cases without compromising convenience. Instead, the  updateTriggers  property gives you fine grained control, enabling you to tell deck.gl exactly which attributes need to change, and when.

Most applications start by using  View  classes. Viewports deck.gl provides a hierarchy of  Viewport  classes. Unless an application needs to project or unproject coordinates in JavaScript, they typically do not directly create  Viewport  classes. Instead,  Viewport  classes are created under the hood based on the  View  class descriptors. Viewport  classes are focused on mathematical operations such as coordinate projection/unprojection and calculation of projection matrices and GLSL uniforms. As mentioned, the basic  Viewport  class is a generic geospatially enabled version of the typical 3D \"camera\" class you would find in most 3D/WebGL/OpenGL library, holding  view  and  projection  matrices and other uniforms needed by the WebGL vertex shaders. While the  Viewport  class can certainly be used directly if you need and are able to calculate your own projection matrices. it is often preferable to use a  Viewport  subclass that takes higher level parameters, such as camera position and viewing direction, or map coordinates, rather than working directly with matrices. In addition to generating WebGL uniforms, the  Viewport  class also offers JavaScript functions to project and unproject as well as getting local distance scales. Overview of Viewports Viewport Class Description Viewport The base viewport has to be supplied view and projection matrices. It is typically only instantiated directly if the application needs to work with viewports that have been supplied from external sources, such as the  WebVR  API. WebMercatorViewport While all  Viewport  subclasses are geospatially enabled, this class renders from a perspective that matches a typical top-down map and is designed to synchronize perfectly with a mapbox-gl base map (even in 3D enabled perspective mode). About Geospatial Positioning A special property of the  Viewport  classes that set them apart from a typical OpenGL Camera class is that it has the necessary plumbing to support non-linear Web Mercator projection. Like many things in deck.gl, Viewports can be positioned using a lng/lat \"anchor\" and a meter offset. See the article about coordinate systems for more information about this setup. Viewport Positioning Viewports allow the application to specify the position and extent of the viewport (i.e. the target rendering area on the screen). Viewport positions are specified in CSS coordinates (top left, non-retina, these coordinates are different from WebGL coordinates, see remarks below). It is expected that CSS coordinates are most natural to work with, as the rest of the UI layout with other HTML components is done in the CSS coordinate system. x,y coordinates  - Viewports allow specification of x,y coordinates in the viewport in addition to width and height. These are only used for positioning (and not for calculation of intrinsic viewport parameters). Remarks About viewport position and size coordinates: Internally,  gl.viewport  uses bottom-left, retina coordinates and normal CSS layout uses top left, non-retina coordinates. Translating between the two is surprisingly fiddly since both y coordinates and heights need to be stacked, and  devicePixelRatio  has to be matched to application settings, so having this translation taken care of by deck.gl was an explicit design goal. For the  project / unproject  JavaScript functions, the default pixel coordinate system of the viewport is defined with the origin in the top left, where the positive x-axis goes right, and the positive y-axis goes down. That is, the top left corner is  [0, 0]  and the bottom right corner is  [width - 1, height - 1] . The functions have a flag that can reverse this convention. Non-pixel projection matrices are bottom-left. Mercator coordinates are specified in \"lng-lat\" format  lng, lat, z  format (which naturally corresponds to  x, y, z ). It is possible to query the WebMercatorViewport for a meters per pixel scale. Note that that distance scales are latitude dependent under web mercator projection (see  http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoom_levels  for more details), so scaling will depend on the viewport center and any linear scale factor should only be expected to be locally correct.","headings":[{"value":"Viewports","depth":1},{"value":"Viewports","depth":2},{"value":"Overview of Viewports","depth":2},{"value":"About Geospatial Positioning","depth":2},{"value":"Viewport Positioning","depth":2},{"value":"Remarks","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/viewports","title":"Viewports"},{"excerpt":"Using Lighting A deck.gl lighting effect is a visual approximation of environment illumination based on simplified models to make rendering appear more realistic.

(list of sample easing functions:  http://easings.net/ ) transitionInterpolator  (Object, optional, default:  LinearInterpolator ) - An interpolator object that defines the transition behavior between two viewports, deck.gl provides  LinearInterpolator  and  FlyToInterpolator . Default value,  LinearInterpolator , performs linear interpolation on view state fields.  FlyToInterpolator  animates  ViewStates  similar to MapBox  flyTo  API and applicable for  MapState , this is pretty useful when camera center changes by long distance. But a user can provide any custom implementation for this object using  TrasitionInterpolator  base class.     transitionInterruption  (Enum, optional, default:  TRANSITION_EVENTS.BREAK ) - This field controls how to process a new view state change that occurs while performing an existing transition. This field has no impact once transition is complete. Here is the list of all possible values with resulting behavior. TRANSITION_EVENTS Result BREAK Current transition will stop at the current state and next view state update is processed. SNAP_TO_END Current transition will skip remaining transition steps and view state is updated to final value, transition is stopped and next view state update is processed. IGNORE Any view state update is ignored until current transition is complete, this also includes view state changes due to user interaction. onTransitionStart  (Functional, optional) - Callback fires when requested transition starts. onTransitionInterrupt  (Functional, optional) - Callback fires when transition is interrupted. onTransitionEnd  (Functional, optional) - Callback fires when transition ends. Usage Sample code that provides  flyTo  style transition to move camera from current location to NewYork city. Sample code to get continuous rotations along vertical axis until user interrupts by rotating the map by mouse interaction. It uses  LinearInterpolator  and restricts transitions for  bearing  prop. Continuous transitions are achieved by triggering new transitions using  onTranstionEnd  callback. Interpolators The following interpolator classes are available out-of-the-box: LinearInterpolator  - a generic interpolator that works with all view types. FlyToInterpolator  - a \"fly to\" style camera transition for geospatial views. You can also implement a custom interpolator. See  TransitionInterpolator . Remarks Deck's transition model is \"set and forget\": the values of the following props at the start of a transition carry through the entire duration of the transition: transitionDuration transitionInterpolator transitionEasing transitionInterruption The default transition behavior can always be intercepted and overwritten in the handler for  onViewStateChange . However, if a transition is in progress, the properties that are being transitioned (e.g. longitude and latitude) should not be manipulated, otherwise the change will be interpreted as an interruption of the transition.","headings":[{"value":"View State Transitions","depth":1},{"value":"Usage","depth":2},{"value":"Interpolators","depth":2},{"value":"Remarks","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/view-state-transitions","title":"View State Transitions"},{"excerpt":"Writing Your Own Layer Preparations Before creating a new layer, it is recommended that you verify that you can not achieve the desired effect either through layer subclassing or through using composite layers. There are a couple of ways to build a layer in deck.gl, and it is helpful to consider what approach will serve you best before starting: Create a composite layer  - A composite layer is a special kind of layer that creates other layers. This allows you to build e.g. a \"semantic layer\" - a layer that presents a different interface (set of props) than an existing layer, transforms those props into a format that fits and existing layer, etc. Subclass a layer  - Subclassed layer is a new layer created by subclassing another layers. This allows the developer to reuse all of the interfaces and implementations of an existing layer unless they are explicitly overridden. Implement a layer from scratch  - If you want to draw something completely different and you are comfortable with WebGL and shader programming, this option gives you the most flexibility. You have full control of the layer lifecycle, you can manage your own model(s) and directly manipulate the WebGL context. Creating The Layer class Your layer class must be a subclass of  Layer . It can be a direct subclass of  Layer , or extend another layer. Naming Your Layer Store the layer name in the  layerName  static property on your  Layer  subclass: The layer name will be used as the default id of layer instances and also during\ndebugging. Defining Layer Properties The list of properties is the main API your new layer will provide to\napplications. So it makes sense to carefully consider what properties\nyour layer should offer. You also need to define the default values of the layer's properties. The most efficient method of doing this is to define a static  defaultProps \nmember on your layer class. Also consider the properties of the base  Layer  class,\nas well as any other inherited properties if you are deriving.","headings":[{"value":"Writing Your Own Layer","depth":1},{"value":"Preparations","depth":2},{"value":"Creating The Layer class","depth":2},{"value":"Naming Your Layer","depth":3},{"value":"Defining Layer Properties","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/custom-layers","title":"Writing Your Own Layer"},{"excerpt":"Layer Attributes This section explains how the data in deck.gl layers are mapped to and accessed by the GPU during rendering. Overview A central concept of deck.gl is that every  Layer  accepts a \"table of data\" (through the  data  prop) and maps into visual elements that are then rendered efficiently on the GPU. For purposes of GPU computation, there are two separate types of layers and two types of attributes. We'll use the following terminology: Geometric Attribute per row Descriptive Attribute per row Shared-Primitive Layer N/A (Use shared primitive) 1  value (instance) per row Variable-Primitive Layer Variable # of vertices ( Ni ) Ni  duplicate values per row Fixed vs Variable Primitive Layers Fixed Primitive Layer  - (Sometimes called  instanced layers ). These layers map each data row to a fixed primitive (set of vertices). Because of this simple mapping, these layers can naturally use instanced rendering, in the sense that the unique attributes for each row (instance) can be described by a single value in an instanced attribute array. Variable Primitive Layer  - (Sometimes called  tesselated layers ). These layers require custom primitive for each row in the data table. The process of generating a custom primitive is referred to as tesselation, and requires extra work during generation. In this case it is not possible to use instancing to represent the unique attributes Examples of  fixed primitive layers  are  CircleLayer ,  PointCloudLayer ,  LineLayer  etc. Examples of  variable primitive layers  are  PathLayer ,  PolygonLayer  etc. Remarks: The primitive in a  fixed primitive layer  can be arbitrarily complex (from a single triangle, through more complex primitives like an extruded hexagon, to an entire mesh or scenegraph loaded from e.g. a glTF file). As the glTF example hints at, there can even be multiple primitives per table row (in multi-model layers). The defining characteristic is just that the primitive(s) are identical for each row. As mentioned,  Fixed primitive layers  are sometimes called  instanced layers , however the term is not precise as it is possible for a tesselated/variable primitive layer to use instanced rendering (e.g. the  PathLayer  currently does this as a performance micro-optimization to reduce the amount of custom geometry generated during tesselation). This use of instancing is not related to efficiently storing the unique values for each table row. Geometric vs Descriptive Attributes Geometric Attributes Positions, Normals, Tangents, Co-Tangents etc. For fixed primitive layers, these attributes are all pre-defined as part of the Layer's reference primitive. For  variable primitive layers , these attributes are normally all generated as a result of the tesselation process, and it is normal to have a unique value for each of these attributes in each vertex. Descriptive Attributes Descriptive Attributes are used to share (non-geometrical) attributes (colors, ...) related to the data in each table row. The big difference between the two layer types is how descriptive attributes are handled. For  fixed primitive layers  the standard setup is very simple: each descriptive attribute is an instanced attribute, with one value for each table row. For  variable primitive layers  there are two options: 2) Copy each descriptive attribute  N  times ( N  being the number of vertices generated for that row during tesselation). This is the method that is used in deck.gl today. 3) Add a single  rowIndex  attribute and copy the same index  N  times as above. In this approach, descriptive values could then be read from textures where they are stored a single time. This provides flexibility at the price of performance (texture access latency) and complexity (working with data in textures). Remarks: In tesselated layers it is of course possible to use the fact that each vertex has a unique value for each descriptive attribute value to achieve certain effects. One could for instance make a custom  PathLayer  that defines a gradient of colors along the path. This technique tends to get harder to use for layers that tesselate triangles in 2D or 3D as the order of vertices is less predictable. Also, if indices are generated in this phase, in which case extra care must be taken since some vertices can be repeated in the geometry. Because of these complications, this is not a promoted customization technique for layers.","headings":[{"value":"Layer Attributes","depth":1},{"value":"Overview","depth":2},{"value":"Fixed vs Variable Primitive Layers","depth":3},{"value":"Geometric vs Descriptive Attributes","depth":2},{"value":"Geometric Attributes","depth":3},{"value":"Descriptive Attributes","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/writing-layers/layer-attributes","title":"Layer Attributes"},{"excerpt":"Views and Projections The same data can be drawn differently to screen based on what projection method is used. deck.gl's view system defines how one or more cameras should be set up to look at your data objects. The default view used in deck.gl is the  MapView , which implements the  Web Mercator projection . \nThe view system is designed to be flexible and composable and can handle many different configurations such as side-by-side views, overlapping views etc. If you plan to work with non-geospatial data, or show more than a single standard viewport, it may be worth spending some time to get familiar with the  View  API. View classes enable applications to specify one or more rectangular viewports and control what should be rendered inside each view. View, View State and Viewport View A  View  instance defines the following information: A unique  id . The position and extent of the view on the canvas:  x ,  y ,  width , and  height . Certain camera parameters specifying how your data should be projected into this view, e.g. field of view, near/far planes, perspective vs. orthographic, etc. The  controller  to be used for this view. A controller listens to pointer events and touch gestures, and translates user input into changes in the view state. If enabled, the camera becomes interactive. To summarize, a  View  instance wraps the \"hard configuration\" of a camera. Once defined, it does not need to change frequently. deck.gl allows multiple views to be specified, allowing the application to divide the screen into multiple similar or different views. These views can be synchronized or separately controlled by the user or the application. View State A  View  instance must be used in combination with a  viewState  object. As the name suggests, the object describes the state of a  View  instance. The view state object defines the temporary properties of a view at runtime, like the camera position, orientation, zoom, etc. If the view is interactive, every time the user pans/rotates/zooms, the view state will be updated to reflect the change. To summarize, a  viewState  object describes the \"real-time properties\" of a camera. It may be updated continuously during interaction and/or transition. Viewport A  Viewport  instance is the camera itself. It is \"resolved\" from a  View  instance and its  viewState . It handles the mathematical operations such as coordinate projection/unprojection, the calculation of projection matrices, and other GLSL uniforms needed by the shaders. Whenever  viewState  updates, the view creates a new viewport under the hood. Typically, the deck.gl user does not need to work with viewports directly. In certain use cases, the JavaScript functions offered by a  Viewport  instance can be handy for projecting and unprojecting coordinates. Types of Views deck.gl offers a set of  View  classes that package the camera and controller logic that you need to visualize and interact with your data. You may choose one or multiple  View  classes based on the type of data (e.g. geospatial, 2D chart) and the desired perspective (top down, first-person, etc). Note that the set of view state parameters that will be used varies between Views. Consult each view class' documentation for a full list of parameters supported. View Class Use Case Status Description View The base view has to be supplied with raw view and projection matrices. It is typically only instantiated directly if the application needs to work with views that have been supplied from external sources, such as the  WebVR API . MapView  (default) geospatial full support This class renders data using the  Web Mercator projection  and is designed to match an external base map library such as mapbox-gl or Google Maps. FirstPersonView geospatial full support The camera is positioned in a provided geolocation and looks in a provided direction, similar to that of a  first-person game . OrthographicView info-vis (2D) full support The camera looks at a target point from top-down. Does not rotate. OrbitView info-vis (3D) full support The camera looks at a target point from a provided direction. Rotates around the target. Examples Using a View Class If the  views  prop of  Deck  is not specified, deck.gl will automatically create a  MapView  that fills the whole canvas, so basic geospatial applications often do not have to specify any  View s. If using non-geospatial data, you will need to manually create a view that is appropriate for info-vis, e.g.: Using a View Class with View State If  initialViewState  is provided, deck.gl automatically tracks the view states of interactive views (used as a \"stateful\" component): If you need to manage and manipulate the view state outside of deck.gl, you may do so by providing an external  viewState  prop (used as a \"stateless\" component). In this case, you also need to listen to the  onViewStateChange  callback and update the  viewState  object yourself: Using Multiple Views deck.gl also supports multiple views by taking a  views  prop that is a list of  View  instances. Views allow the application to specify the position and extent of the viewport (i.e. the target rendering area on the screen) with  x  (left),  y  (top),  width  and  height . These can be specified in either numbers or CSS-like percentage strings (e.g.  width: '50%' ), which is evaluated at runtime when the canvas resizes. Common examples in 3D applications that render a 3D scene multiple times with different \"cameras\": To show views from multiple viewpoints (cameras), e.g. in a split screen setup. To show a detail view (e.g, first person), and an overlaid, smaller \"map\" view (e.g. third person or top down, zoomed out to show where the primary viewpoint is). To support stereoscopic rendering (e.g. VR), where left and right views are needed, providing the necessary parallax between left and right eye. For rendering into offscreen framebuffers, which can then be used for e.g. advanced visual effects, screen shot solutions, overlays onto DOM elements outside of the primary deck.gl canvas (e.g. a video). Example of using with the  WebVR API : Views can also overlap, (e.g. having a small \"mini\" map in the bottom middle of the screen overlaid over the main view) Using Multiple Views with View States When using multiple views, each  View  can either have its own independent view state, or share the same view state as other views. To define the view state of a specific view, add a key to the  viewState  object that matches its view id: Rendering Layers in Multiple Views By default, all visible layers are rendered into all the views. This may not be the case if certain layers are designed to go into one particular view. The  Deck  class'  layerFilter  prop has access to information of the view via the  viewport  argument. It can be used to determine which layers to draw in which view:  Some layers, including  TileLayer ,  Tile3DLayer ,  HeatmapLayer  and  ScreenGridLayer , perform expensive operations (data fetching/aggregation) on viewport change. Therefore, it is generally NOT recommended to render them into multiple views. If you do need to show e.g. tiled base map in multiple views, create one layer instance for each view and limit their rendering with  layerFilter : Picking in Multiple Views deck.gl's built-in picking support extends naturally to multiple viewports. The picking process renders all viewports. Note that the  pickInfo  object does not contain a viewport reference, so you will not be able to tell which viewport was used to pick an object. Similar to the above example, you may control which layer is pickable in which view by supplying a  layerFilter : Auto-Positioning React/HTML Components Behind Views This feature is currently only implemented in the React version of deck.gl. One of the core features of deck.gl is enabling perfectly synchronized visualization overlays on top other React components and DOM elements. When using a single  View , the child components of  DeckGL  are positioned to fill the entire canvas. In this example the  StaticMap  component gets automatically positioned under the default  MapView : When using multiple views, you can wrap component(s) in a  View  tag to align its position and size with a specific view. In the following example, the mapbox component is positioned and stretched to fit the \"minimap\" view: Performance Notes views  and  viewState  props are deep compared to determine if anything changed, so there is little performance cost if new view instances are constructed each render. When  views / viewState  do change, new viewports are constructed. At this point, layers can get a chance to update their state, with the  changeFlags  argument containing  viewportChanged: true . During interaction and transition, this may happen many times a second, raising performance concern if many layers need to recompute their states. By default, most layers ignore viewport changes, so the  updateState  lifecycle method do not get called if nothing else change. However, some layers do need to update state when viewport changes (e.g. the  TileLayer ). To make sure  updateState  is called, the layer needs to override  shouldUpdateState .

The challenge is that in the \"reactive\" model, every change to application state causes everything to be re-rendered. This is not an issue for UI rendering for general purpose apps, but for high performance, graphics intensive and sometime 3D contents to be rendered by WebGL, huge memory buffers (so called \"vertex attributes\", or just \"attributes\" for short) must be prepared and transferred to the GPUs before any draw calls got executed on the GPUs. WebGL Performance Challenges Creating and transferring new WebGL buffers before every draw call would result in unacceptable performance even for moderately complex models. Just like in React (which \"renders\" to the browser's slow-updating DOM), the challenge becomes to detect which part of the visualization is changed to limit both attributes recalculation and re-rendering to the minimum. Since the length of attributes are usually proportional of to the number of data elements being visualized (hundreds of thousands or even multiple millions of elements are not uncommon in big data visualizations), efficient attribute updates is critical. deck.gl alleviates the burden of layer developers by providing an  AttributeManager  class to manage the lifecycle of those WebGL attributes. Note that it is completely possible for a layer to use custom code to manage attribute updates, however most layers rely on the  AttributeManager  class to handle WebGL buffer management for them. Automatic Attribute Generation Automated attribute generation and management is suitable when a set of vertex shader attributes are generated by iteration over a data array, and updates to these attributes are needed either when the data itself changes, or when other data relevant to the calculations change. First the application registers descriptions of its dynamic vertex attributes using AttributeManager.add(). Then, when any change that affects attributes is detected by the application, the app will call AttributeManager.invalidate(). Finally before it renders, it calls AttributeManager.update() to ensure that attributes are automatically rebuilt if anything has been invalidated. The application provided update functions describe how attributes should be updated from a data array and are expected to traverse that data array (or iterable) and fill in the attribute's typed array. Note that the attribute manager intentionally does not do advanced change detection, but instead makes it easy to build such detection by offering the ability to \"invalidate\" each attribute separately. Accessors, Shallow Comparisons and updateTriggers The layer will expect each object to provide a number of \"attributes\" that it can use to set the GL buffers. By default, the layer will look for these attributes to be available as fields directly on the objects during iteration over the supplied data set. To gain more control of attribute access and/or to do on-the-fly calculation of attributes. Note : A layer only renders when a property change is detected. For performance reasons, property change detection uses shallow compare, which means that mutating an element inside a buffer or a mutable data array does not register as a property change, and thus does not trigger a re-render. To force trigger a render after mutating buffers, simply increment the  renderCount  property. To force trigger a buffer update after mutating data, increment the  updateCount  property. Advanced Topics Manual Buffer Management While most apps rely on their layers to automatically generate appropriate WebGL buffers from their props, it is possible for applications to take control of buffer generation and supply the buffers as properties. While this allows for ultimate performance and control of updates, as well as potential sharing of buffers between layers, the application will need to generate attributes in exactly the format that the layer shaders expect, creating a strong coupling between the application and the layer. Note:  The application can provide some buffers and let others be managed by the layer. As an example management of the  instancePickingColors  buffer is normally left to the layer. More information Introduction to Vertex Attributes deck.gl layers use the WebGL technology to render visualization elements. To have the WebGL drawing command work, multiple things need to be provided and configured beforehand and the geometric description of the to-be-rendered element is one of them. In WebGL, all geometry elements are made of a set of vertices, and each vertex has multiple attributes to determine how it will be rendered to the screen. These attributes are called  vertex attributes  and are provided by users using JavaScript typed arrays (e.g.  Float32Array  or  Uint8Array ). During rendering, these vertex attributes will become available in vertex shaders executing on the GPU. Part of designing a new WebGL layer is creating an elegant mapping from a set of data properties in JavaScript to a set of WebGL vertex attributes, and then implement the code that generates the typed arrays that represent the geometry so that GPU calls can be performed efficiently later when drawing the layer. Introduction to Instanced Vertex Attributes Even for high performance rendering API like WebGL, setting up draw calls and dispatching them to GPUs quick become a performance bottleneck for visualizing big data. Therefore, each deck.gl layer aspires to use as few GPU draw calls as possible to draw all everything contained in the data. Here the  Instanced Rendering  comes into play. While some vertex attributes will still describe the geometry of each object (or instance), some vertex attributes will describe what is different between each object or instance. The latter kind of attributes are called instanced attributes. Note:  While \"instanced rendering\" is technically an \"extension\" to WebGL, (meaning that it is not guaranteed to be present in all browsers), today the feature is supported by wide range of systems.\n WebGL Stats  for statistics on how big a percentage of systems support various WebGL features, particularly the  ANGLE_instanced_arrays  extension. In WebGL 2.0, instanced rendering becomes a core feature that needs to be implemented by all vendors. Learning More While you can certainly start consulting detailed WebGL/OpenGL resources to learn more about vertex attributes, be aware that many available resources can get quite technical, involving more concepts than you may need at this point. If you are new to these concepts, we have found that a great way to learn more is simply to copy an existing deck.gl layer and start extending/modifying its functionality.","headings":[{"value":"Attribute Management","depth":1},{"value":"Overview","depth":2},{"value":"WebGL Performance Challenges","depth":2},{"value":"Automatic Attribute Generation","depth":2},{"value":"Accessors, Shallow Comparisons and updateTriggers","depth":3},{"value":"Advanced Topics","depth":2},{"value":"Manual Buffer Management","depth":3},{"value":"More information","depth":2},{"value":"Introduction to Vertex Attributes","depth":3},{"value":"Introduction to Instanced Vertex Attributes","depth":3},{"value":"Learning More","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/custom-layers/attribute-management","title":"Attribute Management"},{"excerpt":"Creating Layer Extensions It's recommended that you read  subclassing layers  before proceeding Sometimes we need to modify several deck.gl layers to add similar functionalities. If we create custom layer classes for each one of them, it will require multiple files that contain more or less the same code.  Layer extension  is a way to generalize, reuse, and share subclassed layer code. Example: Subclassing Is Not Enough Consider a hypothetical use case: in a  ScatterplotLayer , we inject a piece of custom code into the fragment shader to highlight every object that is red. If we want to do the same for  GeoJsonLayer , it becomes more complicated. We will need to subclass all of  ScatterplotLayer ,  PathLayer  and  SolidPolygonLayer , then tell the  GeoJsonLayer  to use our custom classes: We end up with copying and pasting a lot of code. The same functionality can be achieved by creating a layer extension. When we give an extension to a composite layer such as  GeoJsonLayer , it's automatically passed down to all its sublayers, including  ScatterplotLayer ,  PathLayer  and  SolidPolygonLayer . Now we can implement the red filter once and only once in the custom extension, and use it everywhere! LayerExtension Interface Constructor The base layer extension constructor optionally takes one argument  opts  and stores it in  this.opts . This object will be accessible to lifecycle methods via  extension.opts . Additional properties can also be attached to the extension instance in the constructor for future use. Note that if two extension instances are of the same class and have the same  opts  object, they are considered equal during layer updates. Creating a new extension instance with different options can potentially lead to the layers that use this extension to recompile their shaders, which may be an expensive operation.  opts  is generally only used for options that require shader updates. Methods When a layer extension is used, it injects itself into a layer. This means that you can implement most of the  layer lifecycle methods  as part of the extension, and they will be executed in addition to the layer's own. getShaders Called to retrieve the  additional  shader parameters. Returns an object that will be merged with the layer's own  getShaders  result before sending to luma.gl's  shader assembly . See  writing shaders  for deck.gl-specific modules and hooks. When this method is executed,  this  points to the layer. Receives one argument: extension  - the source extension instance. initializeState Called after the layer's own  initializeState . When this method is executed,  this  points to the layer. Arguments: context  - same context object passed to  layer.initializeState . extension  - the source extension instance. updateState Called after the layer's own  updateState . When this method is executed,  this  points to the layer. Arguments: params  - same object passed to  layer.updateState . extension  - the source extension instance. draw Called before the layer's own  draw . When this method is executed,  this  points to the layer. Arguments: params  - same object passed to  layer.draw . extension  - the source extension instance. finalizeState Called after the layer's own  finalizeState . When this method is executed,  this  points to the layer. Arguments: extension  - the source extension instance. getSubLayerProps Called by composite layers to retrieve the  additional  props that should be passed to its sublayers. Normally, a composite layer only passes through props that it recognizes. If an extension adds new props to a layer, then it is responsible of collecting these props by implementing this method. Arguments: extension  - the source extension instance. Example: Layer Extension Back to our example use case. We can implement the red filter with the following code that works with all deck.gl layers: This example is on  codepen .","headings":[{"value":"Creating Layer Extensions","depth":1},{"value":"Example: Subclassing Is Not Enough","depth":2},{"value":"LayerExtension Interface","depth":2},{"value":"Constructor","depth":3},{"value":"Methods","depth":3},{"value":"getShaders","depth":5},{"value":"initializeState","depth":5},{"value":"updateState","depth":5},{"value":"draw","depth":5},{"value":"finalizeState","depth":5},{"value":"getSubLayerProps","depth":5},{"value":"Example: Layer Extension","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/custom-layers/layer-extensions","title":"Creating Layer Extensions"},{"excerpt":"Composite Layers A composite layer is a special kind of layer that creates other layers. It enables the creation of new layers by careful composition of existing layers (a primary example being the  GeoJsonLayer ). In addition, it is often convenient to change the interface and behavior of an existing layer using a composite \"adaptor\" layer instead of modifying the layer itself (the sample  S2Layer  is a simple adaptor on top of the  PolygonLayer ). Use Cases Adaptor Layers Sometimes an existing layer renders the right thing, but it would be desirable that it accepts another data format, had another interface (different accessors), or performed aggregation on its data. Examples could be: A  LASPointCloudLayer  that accepts  data  as an URL pointing to a  LAS \nfile, and convert it to the format that  PointCloudLayer  consumes. A  TopoJSONLayer  that is like the  GeoJsonLayer , but accepts  TopoJSON  provided to the  data  prop. Adding aggregation to an existing layer. By default, deck.gl layers render one graphical element for each element in the  data  prop. But in some cases, e.g. heatmaps, the data needs to be aggregated (or \"binned\") into cells before rendering. An adaptor in the form of a composite layer is one way to add this functionality. The deck.gl layers  TextLayer ,  HexagonLayer ,  CPUGridLayer  and few others are written as composite \"adapter\" layers. Collection Layers Often a more complex visualization is composited from a number of layers that use a common set of props. For example: A  NodeLayer  that renders a text string inside a circle at each anchor position, by combining the  ScatterplotLayer  and the  TextLayer . A  MapLayer  that takes a custom map data format, breaks it down to sets of geometries by type, and render them with the  PathLayer ,  SolidPolygonLayer , and  TextLayer  respectively. Creating a collection layer have the following advantages: Collect the complex code that handles a specific data format or visual configuration into one class. This helps to create a cleaner, more abstract interface for the users of this layer, and control the complexity of the component that renders the  Deck  instance. Improve memory usage by sharing the same objects/buffers cross layers. Instead of each sublayer loading and storing their own copy of the raw data, the composite layer will manage the data source and pass it down to several layers. The deck.gl layers  GeoJsonLayer  and  PolygonLayer  are written as composite \"collection\" layers. Implementing A Composite Layer Consider the following example: we need a layer that is like the  IconLayer , but renders a text label alongside each icon. A composite layer can be created by extending the  CompositeLayer  class: Defining Composite Layer Properties We will need to define the layer-specific properties of the new layer. In this example, the new layer's interface is a combination of that of the  IconLayer  and the  TextLayer : Rendering Sublayers A composite layer should implement the  renderLayers()  method and return an array of layers (\"sublayers\"). In this example, the idea is to draw an  IconLayer  and a  TextLayer , which share the same source data: Mapping Properties Because the composite layer doesn't draw directly to the canvas, it controls the rendering result by setting props of its sublayers. Since the sublayers do not understand our custom layer's prop names, we will need to map the props of the  LabeledIconLayer  to the appropriate props of each sublayer: Something that needs special attention is that all layer ids must be unique, no matter whether they are nested inside other layers. This means the sublayer ids must be generated dynamically based on the id of their parent, otherwise when there are multiple instances of  LabeledIconLayer s their sublayer ids will collide. Finally, to make  updateTriggers  work when accessors need to be recalculated, we need to remap the user's  updateTriggers  from the parent layer's prop names to the sublayers' prop names. Forwarding Properties There are a number of base  Layer  class props that are usually expected to propagate down to all sublayers, such as  pickable ,  visible ,  coordinateSystem  and  opacity . It is desirable to just forward many of these props directly to the sublayers. There is a method  compositeLayer.getSubLayerProps  that handles a lot of these common compliance chore that were mentioned above. When calling it with a list of prop values that we care about, the list gets wrapped/populated with additional props that will help the sublayers align with deck.gl norms. The complete code looks like follows: Picking By default, the composite layer passes the picking info from its sublayers as-is to the callbacks. However, when we implement an adaptor layer that performs data conversion or aggregation, the data that the sublayer sees may not be the same data that the user passed in. In this case, The composite layer may intercept the event info and modify it by implementing the  getPickingInfo()  method: For more details, read about  how picking works . Transforming Data Because deck.gl's primitive layers expect input to be a flat iteratorable data structure, some composite layers need to transform user data into a different format before passing to sublayers. This transformation may consist converting a tree to an array, filtering, sorting, etc. For example, the  GeoJsonLayer  splits features by type and passes each to  ScatterplotLayer ,  PathLayer  or  SolidPolygonLayer  respectively. The  TextLayer  breaks each text string down to multiple characters and render them with a variation of  IconLayer . From the user's perspective, when they specify accessors such as  getColor , or callbacks such as  onHover , the functions should always interface with the original data that they give the top-level layer, instead of its internal implementations. For the sublayer to reference back to the original data, we can add a reference onto every transformed datum by calling  getSubLayerRow : When the sublayer receives data decorated by  getSubLayerRow , its accessors need to know how to read the data to access the original objects. In the above example,  getPosition: d => d.position  would fail if called with  {timestamp: 0} , while the user expects it to be called with  {position: [-122.45, 37.78], timestamps: [0, 1, 4, 7, 8]} . This can be solved by wrapping the user-provided accessor with  getSubLayerAccessor : The default implementations of lifecycle methods such as  getPickingInfo  also understand how to retrieve the original objects from the sublayer data if they are created using  getSubLayerRow .","headings":[{"value":"Composite Layers","depth":1},{"value":"Use Cases","depth":2},{"value":"Adaptor Layers","depth":3},{"value":"Collection Layers","depth":3},{"value":"Implementing A Composite Layer","depth":2},{"value":"Defining Composite Layer Properties","depth":3},{"value":"Rendering Sublayers","depth":3},{"value":"Mapping Properties","depth":3},{"value":"Forwarding Properties","depth":3},{"value":"Picking","depth":3},{"value":"Transforming Data","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/custom-layers/composite-layers","title":"Composite Layers"},{"excerpt":"Layer Lifecycle Every deck.gl layer subclass can define certain methods that get called\nat certain points in its lifecycle. The layer can specify how its state\nis initialized and finalized, if and how it should react to property changes,\nand how it should draw and pick the layer. deck.gl Rendering Cycles Internally, deck.gl sets up the animation loop and calls provided\ncallbacks on initial load and for each rendered frame.\nWhen the deck.gl layer list is drawn to screen, it matches the new Layer\ninstances with the instances from the previous render call, uniquely identified\nby their  id  property.\nEvery time you create a new layer with the same  id  property as a layer you\nrendered last time, deck.gl consider the new layer instance an \"update\" of the\nold instance. layer.state  is an object that is internal to an instance of a layer.\nWhen a new layer instance is matched to an existing layer instance by  id ,\nthe state object of the old layer becomes accessible to the new layer.\nLayers can use the state object to store persistent information cross rendering cycles. Layer Lifecycle Stages Initialization Initialization happens only once for each layer that is being added, i.e. a layer from the\ncurrent rendering cycle whose  id  does not get matched with any layer in the previous\ncycle.\n layer.initializeState()  is called at\nthis stage. At the end of initialization,\n layer.updateState()  is called\nbefore the first render. Updating Updating happens when a new layer has been matched with a layer from the previous\nrendering cycle (resulting in new props being passed to that layer),\nor when context has changed and layers are about to be drawn. layer.shouldUpdateState() \nis called to determine if the layer needs an update. The default implementation updates on prop and data changes, but not on viewport changes, so screen-space based layers may want to override this (see e.g. ScreenGridLayer).\nUnder more complicated circumstances, additional checks can be supplied through the\n dataComparator \nprop. If the layer does need to be updated,\n layer.updateState() \nis called to perform any necessary operation before the layer is rendered.\nThis usually involves recalculating an attribute by calling\n state.attributeManager.invalidate \nand updating uniforms by calling  model.setUniforms .\nBy default, when  props.data  changes, all attributes are invalidated and recalculated. A composite layer may use\n compositeLayer.renderLayers() \nto insert one or more deck.gl layers after itself.\nThe generated layers will then be matched and updated,\nallowing the decomposition of the drawing of a complex data set\ninto \"primitive\" layers.

Picking Happens when a pointer moves over or clicks on the deck.gl canvas. layer.draw()  of all pickable layers\nare called with special uniforms to draw into an off-screen picking buffer. When a layer is picked,\n layer.getPickingInfo() \nis called to generate the  info  object of information about what has been picked.\nThis object is then passed to the  onHover  or  onClick  callbacks of the layer.

Finalization Happens for each layer that is being removed, i.e. a layer from the previous\nrendering cycle whose  id  did not get matched with any layer in the current\ncycle.\n layer.finalizeState() \nis called just before the reference to the state of that layer\nis released. Comparison with React's Lifecycle If you are familiar with React and the\n React component lifecycle \nyou will quickly understand the deck.gl layer lifecycle as it is based on\nsimilar ideas. In particular, experience with the React lifecycle should help\nyou understand property change management and how to use the\n shouldUpdateState  and  updateState  methods. Still, there are a couple of notable differences between the lifecycle\nmethods provided by the two frameworks: deck.gl performs preliminary analysis on certain props and context and\nprovides a  changeFlags  object to your  shouldUpdateState  and\n updateState . deck.gl's  updateState  method is called both on layer initialization and\non when props or context is updated. This is different from React's\n willReceiveProps  that is not called when the component is initially created,\nThe deck.gl model avoids requiring the same property checks to be performed\ntwice in both the constructor and  willReceiveProps . deck.gl separates rendering into the  draw  and  renderLayers  methods,\nwhere React just needs  render . deck.gl's  pick  and  pickInfo  methods have no correspondence in\nReact's lifecycle. Note : deck.gl uses a simpler component model than React.\n  While React backs instance with a separate component, deck.gl just transfers\n  the old layers' state objects to any new matched layers. Note : the data prop, attribute props and the viewport context are\n  central to deck.gl layers and get special handling. React is more generic\n  and leaves the interpretation of most props to the component.","headings":[{"value":"Layer Lifecycle","depth":1},{"value":"deck.gl Rendering Cycles","depth":2},{"value":"Layer Lifecycle Stages","depth":2},{"value":"Initialization","depth":3},{"value":"Updating","depth":3},{"value":"Rendering","depth":3},{"value":"Picking","depth":3},{"value":"Finalization","depth":3},{"value":"Comparison with React's Lifecycle","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/custom-layers/layer-lifecycle","title":"Layer Lifecycle"},{"excerpt":"Picking Make sure you have read  Interactivity  before reading this section. How It Works The Color Picking Technique Rather than doing traditional ray-casting or building octrees etc in JavaScript, deck.gl implements picking on the GPU using a technique we refer to as \"color picking\". When deck.gl needs to determine what is under the mouse (e.g. when the user moves or clicks the pointer over the deck.gl canvas), all pickable layers are rendered into an off-screen buffer, but in a special mode activated by a GLSL uniform. In this mode, the shaders of the core layers render picking colors instead of their normal visual colors. Each object in each layer gets its own picking color assigned. The picking color is determined using  layer.encodePickingColor()  that converts the index of a object of a given layer into a 3-byte color array (the color buffer allows us to distinguish between 16M unique colors per layer, and between 256 different layers). After the picking buffer is rendered, deck.gl looks at the color of the pixel under the pointer, and decodes it back to the index number using  layer.decodePickingColor() . Event Propagation Once an object is picked, deck.gl creates a  picking info  object that describes what is under the pointer. The  layer.getPickingInfo()  method is called first on the layer that directly rendered the picked object, to modify or add additional fields to the info. The info object is then passed to the  getPickingInfo()  of its parent layer, and then its grandparent, and so on. This is so that composite layers can further augment the  info  object after it is processed by the picked sublayer. This allows the composite layer to hide implementation details and expose only user-friendly information. When the processing chain is over, the event is invoked on the top-level layer. This means that only the top-level layer's  on<Event>  callbacks are invoked, and the final picking info's  layer  field will point to the top-level layer. The idea is that the user should only interface with the layer that they created, and not having to know the underlying implementation. When an event fires, the callback functions are executed in the following order: layer.on<Event>  (default implementation invokes  this.props.on<Event> ) layer.props.on<Event>  (only if the layer method is not defined) deck.props.on<Event> If any of the callback functions return  true , the event is marked handled and the rest of the callbacks will be skipped. Default Handling of Pointer Events Whenever the pointer moves over the canvas, deck.gl performs a new picking pass, yielding a picking info object describing the result. This object is used for multiple purposes: The  onHover  callbacks are called with it To update the picked layer if  autoHighlight  is enabled Saved for later use When other gestures (click, drag, etc.) are detected, deck.gl does not repeat picking. Instead, their callbacks are called with the last picked info from  hover . Implementing Custom Picking While deck.gl allows applications to implement picking however they want,\nspecial support is provided for the built-in \"picking color\" based picking\nsystem, which most layers use. To take full control of picking, a layer need to take the following steps: Creating A Picking Color Attribute Add an attribute for each vertex using the layer's  AttributeManager : Populate the attribute by providing a different picking color for every object that you need to differentiate. The default implementation of  layer.encodePickingColor()  and  layer.decodePickingColor()  is likely sufficient, but you may need to implement your own pair. By default, the  object  field of the picking  info  object is indexed from the layer's  data  prop. Custom layers often need to define on their own terms what constitutes meaningful information to the user's callbacks. A layer can achieve this by overriding  layer.getPickingInfo()  to add or modify fields to the  info  object. Model object creation If your layer creates its own  Model  object, add picking module to  modules  array. Implementing Picking in Custom Shaders All core layers (including composite layers) support picking using luma.gl's  picking module . If you are using custom shaders with any of the core layers or building custom layers with your own shaders, the following steps are needed to enable picking: Vertex Shader Vertex shader should set current picking color using  picking_setPickingColor  method provided by picking shader module. Fragment Shader Fragment shader should use  picking_filterPickingColor  to update  gl_FragColor , which outputs picking color if it is the picking pass. For more details refer to luma.gl's  Picking Module .","headings":[{"value":"Picking","depth":1},{"value":"How It Works","depth":2},{"value":"The Color Picking Technique","depth":3},{"value":"Event Propagation","depth":3},{"value":"Default Handling of Pointer Events","depth":3},{"value":"Implementing Custom Picking","depth":2},{"value":"Creating A Picking Color Attribute","depth":3},{"value":"Model object creation","depth":3},{"value":"Implementing Picking in Custom Shaders","depth":3},{"value":"Vertex Shader","depth":4},{"value":"Fragment Shader","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/custom-layers/picking","title":"Picking"},{"excerpt":"Primitive Layers If you want to draw something completely different and you are comfortable around WebGL, you may consider implementing a new layer by directly extending the  Layer  class. Implementing the Layer Lifecycle Functions To describe how a layer's properties relate to WebGL attributes and uniforms you need to implement the layer's  lifecycle functions . Initializing Layer initializeState()  - This is the one method that you must implement to create any WebGL resources you need for rendering your layer. Creating The Model A layer should create its model during this phase. A model is a  luma.gl   Model  instance that defines what will be drawn to the WebGL context. Most layers are  Single-model layers  - this is the predominant form among all core layers that deck.gl currently provides. In these layers, a single geometry model is created for each layer and saved to  state.model  during initialization. The default implementation of the rest of the lifecycle methods will then look for this model for rendering and picking etc., meaning that you don't have to do anything more to get a working layer. A choice to make is whether your WebGL primitives (draw calls) should be instanced, or use dynamic geometry: Instanced layer  - This type of layer renders the same geometry many times. Usually the simplest way to go when creating a layer that renders a lot of similar objects (think ScatterplotLayer, ArcLayers etc). Dynamic geometry layer  - This is needed when dealing with data that needs to be rendered using multiple similar but unique geometries, such as polygons (i.e. the geometries are not copies of each other that that only differ in terms of parameters). It is sometimes desirable to have a single layer render using multiple geometry primitives (e.g both circles and lines, or triangles and textured meshes etc), rather than creating separate layers. The custom  AxesLayer example  uses this technique to share attributes between grids and labels. Defining Attributes A layer should also define its attributes during initialization. This allows the  attribute manager  to do the heavy lifting for  Attribute Management . Define attributes by calling  attributeManager.add : Handling property updates updateState()  - This is the method that you may want to implement to handle property changes. The key to writing good, performant deck.gl layers lies in understanding how to minimize updates of any calculated data, such as WebGL. The ideas used here are very similar to (and directly inspired by) those used in the React/Redux/Flux/Immutable.js communities, and learning more about those frameworks can be helpful as a way to get a better understanding of how to use these concepts in the best way. data  - Typically if a layer is re-rendered with a changed  data  prop, all WebGL attributes must be regenerated and the layer needs to be redrawn. The default is to do exactly that, but sometimes a layer can be smarter and limit updates, or more work needs to be done. If the viewport has changed, the layer will automatically be re-rendered. Many layers can thus ignore viewport changes, however, if the layer has any dependencies on the viewport (such as a layer that calculates extents or positions in screen space rather than world space) it would need to update state or uniforms whenever the viewport changes. If other props change, it would typically mean that the layer needs to update some uniform or state so that rendering is affected appropriately. Rendering Layer draw()  - If you want to use custom uniforms or settings when drawing, you would typically implement the  draw  method and pass those to your render call. Note that  draw  is called with viewport uniforms that you need to pass to your shader, but you can of course add any layer specific uniforms to that. Note: the reason that the supplied uniforms need to be passed on to your shaders is to enable your shader to use deck.gl's GLSL shaderlibs (such as  project  or  project64  etc.). If you don't use these shaderlibs, you would obviously not need to supply these uniforms, but you would have to implement features like cartographic projection etc. on your own. Destroying Layer finalizeState()  - If implemented, this method is called when your layer state is discarded. This is a good time to destroy non-shared WebGL resources directly, rather than waiting for the garbage collector to do it. Handling Coordinate Systems While you have the freedom to create any type of layer you want, with any type of coordinate system that suits your application, a common characteristic of the layers provided by deck.gl is that they work seamlessly as map overlays, both with positions specified as longitude and latitude coordinates, as well as with positions specified in meters. Making Shaders Work with deck.gl's Coordinate Systems By supplying the  modules: ['project']  parameter when you create your layer's luma.gl  Model  you get access to deck.gl's  family of GLSL projection methods  that support all three deck.gl projection modes: latlon (default), meters and neutral. By always using the following shader functions for handling projections and scaling, a single layer class can support all projection modes for free: All positions must be passed through the  project_position  function (available both in JavaScript and GLSL) to convert non-linear web-mercator coordinates to linear mercator \"world\" or \"pixel\" coordinates, that can be passed to the projection matrix. All offsets must be passed through the  project_scale  function (available both in JavaScript and GLSL) to convert distances to world coordinates. Note that that distance scales are latitude dependent under web mercator projection (see  http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoom_levels  for more details), so scaling will depend on the viewport center and should only be expected to be locally correct. Implement Picking If your layer is instanced ( data  prop is an array and each element is rendered as one primitive), then you may take advantage of the default implementation of the  layer picking methods . By default, each layer creates an  instancePickingColors  attribute and automatically calculates it using the length of the  data  array.

A number of deck.gl features are enabled by rich descriptions of the types of the properties in a layer: Asynchronous props (e.g. loading layer data from an URL) Type checking (during development) Improve render performance, see \"Prop Types and Performance\" section below Transitions and Animation Reflection  (e.g. dynamically creating UI controls for layer props) Declaring Layer Properties A layer class may supply a static member  defaultProps  that defines its default property types and values: When the user construct this layer, the props are resolved as such: Property Types The property types system enables layers to opt-in to specifying types, and also allows a certain amount of type auto-deduction to happen based on existing default values for layers that do not opt in. Each prop in  defaultProps  may be an object in the following shape: type  (string, required) value  (any, required) - the default value if this prop is not supplied async  (boolean, optional) - if  true , the prop can either be a  Promise  that resolves to its actual value, or an url string (loaded using the base Layer's  fetch  prop). validate  (function, optional) - receives  value  as argument and returns  true  if the value is valid. Validation of layer props is only invoked in debug mode. This function is automatically populated if the prop has a built-in type. equal  (function, optional) - receives  value1 ,  value2  as argument and returns  true  if the two values are equal. Comparison of layer props is invoked during layer update and the result is passed to  changeFlags.propsChanged . This function is automatically populated if the prop has a built-in type. deprecatedFor  (string|array, optional) - mark this prop as deprecated. The value is the new prop name(s) that this prop has been deprecated for. If the old prop is supplied instead of the new one, its value will be transferred to the new prop. The user will get a warning about the deprecation. Any additional options, see individual types below. Built-in Types boolean Any value.

Consider the following app: Each time the user interacts with the viewport, the app state is updated, and  render()  is called. Because  getElevation ,  getFillColor  and  getLineColor  are functions and arrays defined inline, they have changed from the previous render. Usually, any prop change results in updating a layer, that is, recomputing its internal states. Updating a layer could be expensive. In GeoJsonLayer's case, it creates ScatterplotLayer, PolygonLayer and PathLayer, and those layers also need to be updated recursively. In reality, we do not want to update GeoJsonLayer, because no layer props changed from the user's perspective. In GeoJsonLayer, these props are declared as such: The default comparator of the  access  prop type ignores shallow changes in functions. As a result, deck.gl decides that no props have changed between the two renders, and the GeoJsonLayer does not need to be updated.","headings":[{"value":"Property Types","depth":1},{"value":"Declaring Layer Properties","depth":2},{"value":"Property Types","depth":2},{"value":"Built-in Types","depth":3},{"value":"boolean","depth":5},{"value":"number","depth":5},{"value":"color","depth":5},{"value":"array","depth":5},{"value":"accessor","depth":5},{"value":"function","depth":5},{"value":"Prop Types and Performance","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/custom-layers/prop-types","title":"Property Types"},{"excerpt":"generateLayerTests This utility generates a series of test cases to be used with  testLayer  that checks the conformance of a layer class.

DeckGL  is a React component that takes a list of deck.gl layer instances and a view state, and renders those layers on a transparent canvas that can be used as an overlay over other components like maps. Make sure to read the  Using deck.gl with React  article. The  DeckGL  class is a React wrapper of the  Deck  JavaScript class which exposes essentially the same props. The  Deck  class should not be used directly in React applications. Usage Like any React component,  DeckGL  can accept child components. Child components are often maps (e.g. the  StaticMap  component from react-map-gl), but can be any React components. Properties DeckGL  accepts all  Deck  properties, with these additional semantics: React Context ContextProvider  (React.Component, optional) A  Context.Provider  component. If supplied, will be rendered as the ancestor to all children. The passed through context contains the following values: viewport  ( Viewport ) - the current viewport container  (DOMElement) - the DOM element containing the deck canvas eventManager  ( EventManager ) Children The following semantics of the standard React  children  property are considered experimental. JSX layers It is possible to use JSX syntax to create deck.gl layers as React children of the  DeckGL  React components, instead of providing them as ES6 class instances to the  layers  prop. Caveat: The JSX layer syntax is limited in that it only works when the layers are direct children of the  DeckGL  component. deck.gl layers are not true React components and cannot be rendered independently by React, and the JSX support depends on deck.gl intercepting the JSX generated child elements before React tries to render them. JSX views It is possible to use JSX syntax to create deck.gl views as React children of the  DeckGL  React components, instead of providing them as ES6 class instances to the  views  prop. If a certain view id is used in both JSX views and the  views  prop, the view instance in the  views  prop has priority. Position Children in Views To make it easy to use React components in combination with deck.gl views (e.g. to place a base map under a view, or add a label on top of a view), deck.gl can make such components automatically adjust as that view is added, removed or resized. Each child element of  DeckGL  is positioned inside a view. All children of a view is wrapped in a DOM container that: is offset to be relative to the deck.gl view that it corresponds to. is resized to match the extent of the deck.gl view with the corresponding view id. is hidden if the view id is missing from  DeckGL 's  views  prop. The containing view of each element is determined as follows: If the element is a direct child of  DeckGL , it is positioned inside the default (first) view. If the element is nested under a  <View id={id}>  tag, it is positioned inside the view corresponding to the  id  prop.  Render callbacks You may supply a function as a child to the  DeckGL  or  View  node (see  JSX views ). The function will be called to retrieve the React children when the viewport updates. The following arguments are passed: x  - the left offset of the current view, in pixels y  - the top offset of the current view, in pixels width  - the width of the current view, in pixels height  - the height of the current view, in pixels viewState  - the view state of the current view viewport  - the  Viewport  instance of the current view This is useful when you need to specify custom rendering logic for a child: Additional Notes: The DeckGL components own  canvas  element is added last to the child list, to sit on top of all the base components, however Z index can be used to override this. Child repositioning is done with CSS styling on a wrapper div. Children that do not belong to any  <View>  tag and are functions are called with the properties of the default view. Children that do not belong to any  <View>  tag and are valid React elements are rendered as is. Methods All  Deck  methods are available on the  DeckGL  component, but not all of them can be explicitly called. For example, to rerender your component, you can pass updated props to  DeckGL  component directly, while you should call  setProps  with new props in  Deck .  The public methods you can call explicitly list below: pickObject pickMultipleObjects pickObjects We do recommend you to use the pure JavaScript version of deck.gl if you are more comfortable with an imperative programming style (e.g.  deck.setProps() ).

Tests can be run: Completely in Node.js (lifecycle tests only). Completely in the Browser (lifecycle and rendering tests). From Node in a controlled Browser instance (with  probe.gl 's  BrowserTestDriver ). Installation The deck.gl test utilities are published as a separate npm module that is only intended to be used during development. Install it as as a \"dev dependency\" as follows: or You typically want the major and minor version of   @deck.gl/test-utils  to match the version of  @deck.gl/core  that you are using. i.e. you want to use  5.2.x  and  5.2.y  together. Check and if necessary edit your  package.json  to make sure things align. Layer Conformance Tests Layer conformance tests are designed to verify deck.gl that layers update their internal state correctly in response to various props and prop changes. The layer update test support includes test drivers to initialize a layer and then run a sequence of successive updates, with facilities for validating the layer after each change, and also provides functions to initialize, update and render layers in a test environment. Note that internally in deck.gl, updates are handled by the deck.gl layer \"lifecycle\" and these tests are therefore also called \"lifecycle tests\". Lifecycle tests are less demanding of the WebGL environment than rendering tests described below and are thus easily integrated in traditional Node.js unit test suites (e.g. based on  tape ,  jest  or similar unit test frameworks). Layer Rendering Tests Rendering tests are a key feature of deck.gl's test utils. Rendering tests involve rendering layers with known inputs and performing pixel-comparison between the results against \"golden images\". Currently, rendering tests requires running layers with predefined props and views in a controlled Chrome instance, reporting values back to Node.js. Testing Applications instead of Layers The current test utilities are focused on testing of layers. This might seem to make them less suited for testing deck.gl code in applications. Still, there are techniques that can be used to get parts of the application's rendering stack tested. Applications that render multiple layers can e.g. render them with mock application data, and compare the result against a golden image. More direct support for application testing is under consideration. Future support might include rendering layers directly in Node.js under headless gl, enabling apps to be tested in CI environments, as well as support for \"snapshotting\" deck.gl output inside live applications and comparing against golden images.","headings":[{"value":"@deck.gl/test-utils","depth":1},{"value":"Installation","depth":2},{"value":"Layer Conformance Tests","depth":2},{"value":"Layer Rendering Tests","depth":2},{"value":"Testing Applications instead of Layers","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/api-reference/test-utils/overview","title":"@deck.gl/test-utils"},{"excerpt":"MapboxLayer MapboxLayer  is an implementation of  mapbox 's custom layer API.

The  modules  parameter passed to the  Model  class can dynamically include parts from this library into your own GLSL code: Shader Assembly Your shaders will be run through the luma.gl  shader assembler , which injects code from various module dependencies, The generated shader always contains a prologue of platform defines, and then the modules (see below), and finally your shader code is added. Platform defines This \"virtual\" module is a dynamically generated prologue containing #defines describing your graphics card and platform. It is designed to work around certain platform-specific issues to allow the same rendering results are different GPUs and platforms. It is automatically injected by  assembleShaders  before any modules are included. Shader Modules projection The  project  shader module is part of the core of deck.gl. It makes it easy to write shaders that support all of deck.gl's projection modes and it supports some advanced rendering techniques such as pixel space rendering etc. The  project  module also has two extensions,  project32  and  project64 . lighting A simple lighting package is provided in deck.gl, supporting a single directional light in addition to ambient light. Turning on lighting requires normals to be provided for each vertex. There are two flavors: gouraudLighting  - for lighting calculated in the vertex shader phongLighting  - for lighting calculated in the fragment shader fp64 The fp64 shader math library can be used leveraged by developers to conduct numerical computations that requires high numerical accuracy. This shader math library uses \"multiple precision\" algorithms to emulate 64-bit double precision floating point numbers, with some limitations, using two 32-bit single precision floating point numbers. To use it, just set the \"fp64\" key to \"true\" when calling  assembleShaders . Please refer to the \"64-bit layers\" section in the document for more information. Note that for geospatial projection, deck.gl v6.1 introduced a \"hybrid\" 32-bit projection mode that provides the precision of 64-bit projection with the performance of 32-bit calculations, so it is recommended that any use of  fp64  be used for non-position-projection related use cases. picking Picking is supported using luma.gl  picking shader module . Standard Shader Hooks When  subclassing  an official deck.gl layer with minor feature additions, it is possible to inject custom code into predefined locations into the original shaders. These hooks are considered the public API of layers that will work consistently cross minor releases. vs:#decl Inject into the top of the vertex shader (declarations). vs:#main-start Inject into the the very beginning of the main function in the vertex shader. vs:#main-end Inject into the the very end of the main function in the vertex shader. vs:DeckGL_FILTER_SIZE Inject into a function in the vertex shader to manipulate the size of a geometry. Called before projection. Arguments: inout vec3 size  - offset of the current vertex from  geometry.worldPosition  in common space. VertexGeometry geometry  - descriptor of the current geometry vs:DeckGL_FILTER_GL_POSITION Inject into a function in the vertex shader to manipulate the projected position of the current vertex. Called after projection. Arguments: inout vec4 position  - position of the current vertex in clipspace VertexGeometry geometry  - descriptor of the current geometry vs:DeckGL_FILTER_COLOR Inject into a function in the vertex shader to manipulate the color of the current geometry. Called after projection. Arguments: inout vec4 color  - color of the current geometry, RGBA in the  [0, 1]  range VertexGeometry geometry  - descriptor of the current geometry fs:#decl Inject into the top of the fragment shader (declarations). fs:#main-start Inject into the the very beginning of the main function in the fragment shader. fs:#main-end Inject into the the very end of the main function in the fragment shader. fs:DeckGL_FILTER_COLOR Inject into a function in the vertex shader to manipulate the color of the current geometry. Called after projection. Arguments: inout vec4 color  - color of the current geometry, RGBA in the  [0, 1]  range FragmentGeometry geometry  - descriptor of the current geometry VertexGeometry struct vec3 worldPosition  - The world position of the current geometry, usually populated from a  getPosition  accessor. vec3 worldPositionAlt  - The secondary world position of the current geometry. This property is populated if the geometry is instanced between a source position and a target position, for example  ArcLayer . vec3 normal  - The normal at the current vertex in common space. Only populated for 3D layers. vec2 uv  - The uv position at the current vertex. vec4 position  - The position of the current vertex in common space. Populated during projection. vec3 pickingColor  - The picking color of the current vertex. FragmentGeometry struct vec2 uv  - The uv position at the current vertex. Shader Techniques and Ideas Filtering and Brushing (Vertex and Fragment Shaders) When rendering large data sets (especially a lot of intersecting lines or arcs) it can be hard to see the structure in the data in the resulting visualization. A useful technique in these cases is to use \"brushing\". Sometimes, being able to filter out a specific color, or range of colors, from the data without modifying the data container itself can be helpful for performance or just code simplification reasons. This is also a feature that can easily be added to a deck.gl shader. Tip:  Use  discard  in the fragment shader instead of 0 alpha. Faster and leaves the depth buffer unaffected. Animation (Vertex Shader) A powerful capability of deck.gl is to render layers with thousands of animated and/or interactive objects with the computing power of GPUs. Creating an animated layer can be as easy as having the application supply start and end positions for every object, and a time interval over which to animate, and have the vertex shader interpolate the positions for every frame using a simple  mix  GLSL instruction. Uniforms Layer prop uniforms float layerIndex The layerIndex is a small integer that starts at zero and is incremented for each layer that is rendered. It can be used to add small offsets to the z coordinate of layers to resolve z-fighting between overlapping layers. float opacity In the fragment shader, multiply the fragment color with the opacity uniform. Shader Module Uniforms The luma.gl/deck.gl shader modules provide javascript functions to set their uniforms but the actual GLSL uniforms are typically considered implementation dependent. The intention is that you should use the public functions exposed by each shader module. That said, some uniforms from the  project  module are considered special and are documented. Remarks Use With Other GLSL Code Assemblers  - Your shader code can be run through another GLSL code assembler like  glslify  before you pass it to  assembleShaders . This means that you are not forced to work with only luma.gl shader modules, you can use multiple techniques to organize your shader code to fit your project needs.","headings":[{"value":"Writing Shaders","depth":1},{"value":"Shader Assembly","depth":2},{"value":"Platform defines","depth":3},{"value":"Shader Modules","depth":3},{"value":"projection","depth":4},{"value":"lighting","depth":4},{"value":"fp64","depth":4},{"value":"picking","depth":4},{"value":"Standard Shader Hooks","depth":3},{"value":"vs:#decl","depth":5},{"value":"vs:#main-start","depth":5},{"value":"vs:#main-end","depth":5},{"value":"vs:DeckGL_FILTER_SIZE","depth":5},{"value":"vs:DeckGL_FILTER_GL_POSITION","depth":5},{"value":"vs:DeckGL_FILTER_COLOR","depth":5},{"value":"fs:#decl","depth":5},{"value":"fs:#main-start","depth":5},{"value":"fs:#main-end","depth":5},{"value":"fs:DeckGL_FILTER_COLOR","depth":5},{"value":"VertexGeometry struct","depth":3},{"value":"FragmentGeometry struct","depth":3},{"value":"Shader Techniques and Ideas","depth":2},{"value":"Filtering and Brushing (Vertex and Fragment Shaders)","depth":3},{"value":"Animation (Vertex Shader)","depth":3},{"value":"Uniforms","depth":2},{"value":"Layer prop uniforms","depth":3},{"value":"float layerIndex","depth":5},{"value":"float opacity","depth":5},{"value":"Shader Module Uniforms","depth":3},{"value":"Remarks","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/custom-layers/writing-shaders","title":"Writing Shaders"},{"excerpt":"ScenegraphLayer The  ScenegraphLayer  renders a number of instances of a complete luma.gl scenegraph.

Advantages and Limitations Advantages Mapbox and deck.gl layers can be freely \"interleaved\", enabling a number of layer mixing effects, such as drawing behind map labels, z-occlusion between deck.gl 3D objects and Mapbox buildings, etc. Mapbox and deck.gl will share a single canvas and WebGL context, saving system resources. Limitations deck.gl's multi-view system cannot be used. Unless used with react-map-gl, WebGL2 based deck.gl features, such as attribute transitions and GPU accelerated aggregation layers cannot be used. Installation Include the Standalone Bundle Install from NPM Examples Using with Pure JS To create a Mapbox-compatible deck.gl layer: To add the layer to Mapbox: Using with React Injecting Layers into Mapbox Adding a 3D deck layer In this cases, the application wants to add a deck.gl 3D layer (e.g. ArcLayer, HexagonLayer, GeoJsonLayer) on top of a Mapbox basemap, while seamlessly blend into the z-buffer. This will interleave the useful visualization layers from both the deck.gl and Mapbox layer catalogs. In this case, the Mapbox  map.addLayer(layer)  API method can be used to add a mix of deck.gl and Mapbox layers to the top of the layer stack from the currently loaded Mapbox style. Inserting a 2D deck layer before an existing Mapbox layer One major use case for mixing deck.gl and Mapbox layers is that some important information in the Mapbox map is hidden by a deck.gl visualization layer, and controlling opacity is not enough. A typical example of this is labels and roads, where it is desirable to have a deck.gl visualization layer render on top of the Mapbox geography, but where one might still want to see e.g. labels and/or roads. Alternatively, the deck.gl visualization should cover the ground, but not the roads and labels. A bit more control is provided by the optional  before  parameter of the Mapbox  map.addLayer(layer, before?)  API. Using this parameter, it is possible to inject a  MapboxLayer  instance just before any existing Mapbox layer in the layer stack of the currently loaded style. Mapbox provides an example of  finding the first label layer .

There are two approaches to load icons. You can pre-generated a sprite image ( iconAtlas ), which packs all your icons\ninto one layout, and a JSON descriptor ( iconMapping ), which describes the position and size of each icon in the  iconAtlas .\nYou can create sprite images with tools such as  TexturePacker . This is the\nmost efficient way to load icons. It is also possible to ask  IconLayer  to generate  iconAtlas  dynamically. This is slower but might be useful in certain\nuse cases. Example: pre-packed iconAtlas Example: auto packing iconAtlas In some use cases, it is not possible to know the icons that will be used. Instead, each icon needs to be fetched from\na programmatically generated URL at runtime. For example, if you want to visualize avatars of github contributors for\na project on a map, it is not convenient for you to generate the  iconAtlas  with all the contributors' avatars.\nIn this case, you can follow the example. Auto packing icons is less efficient than pre-packed. Installation To install the dependencies from NPM: To use pre-bundled scripts: Properties Inherits from all  Base Layer  properties. iconAtlas  (Texture2D | String) Atlas image url or texture iconMapping  (Object | String) Icon names mapped to icon definitions. Each icon is defined with the following values: x  (Number, required): x position of icon on the atlas image y  (Number, required): y position of icon on the atlas image width  (Number, required): width of icon on the atlas image height  (Number, required): height of icon on the atlas image anchorX  (Number, optional): horizontal position of icon anchor. Default: half width. anchorY  (Number, optional): vertical position of icon anchor. Default: half height. mask  (Boolean, optional): whether icon is treated as a transparency mask.\nIf  true , user defined color is applied.\nIf  false , pixel color from the image is applied. User still can specify the opacity through getColor.\nDefault:  false If you go with pre-packed strategy, both  iconAtlas  and  iconMapping  are required. If you choose to use auto packing, then  iconAtlas  and  iconMapping  should not be provided,\notherwise it causes error since  IconLayer  will attempt to retrieve icons from\ngiven pre-packed  iconAtlas . sizeScale  (Number, optional)  Default:  1 Icon size multiplier. sizeUnits  (String, optional) Default:  pixels The units of the size specified by  getSize , one of  'meters' ,  'pixels' . When zooming in and out, meter sizes scale with the base map, and pixel sizes remain the same on screen. sizeMinPixels  (Number, optional)  Default:  0 The minimum size in pixels. sizeMaxPixels  (Number, optional)  Default:  Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER The maximum size in pixels. billboard  (Boolean, optional) Default:  true If on, the icon always faces camera. Otherwise the icon faces up (z) alphaCutoff  (Number, optional) Default:  0.05 Discard pixels whose opacity is below this threshold. A discarded pixel would create a \"hole\" in the icon that is not considered part of the object. This is useful for customizing picking behavior, e.g. setting  alphaCutoff: 0, autoHighlight  will highlight an object whenever the cursor moves into its bounding box, instead of over the visible pixels. loadOptions  (Object, optional) On top of the  default options , also accepts options for the following loaders: ImageLoader  if the  iconAtlas  prop is an URL, or if  getIcon  returns URLs for auto-packing Data Accessors getIcon  ( Function , optional) Default:  d => d.icon Method called to retrieve the icon name of each object, returns string or object. If you go with pre-packed strategy, then  getIcon  should return a string representing name of the icon,\nused to retrieve icon definition from given  iconMapping . If you choose to use auto packing, then  getIcon  should return an object which contains\nthe following properties. url  (String, required): url to fetch the icon height  (Number, required): height of icon width  (Number, required): width of icon id : (String, optional): unique identifier of the icon, fall back to  url  if not specified anchorX ,  anchorY ,  mask  are the same as mentioned in  iconMapping IconLayer  use  id  (fallback to  url ) to dedupe icons. If for the same icon identifier,  getIcon  returns different  width  or  height ,  IconLayer  will only apply the first occurrence and ignore the rest of them. getPosition  ( Function , optional)  Default:  d => d.position Method called to retrieve the position of each object, returns  [lng, lat, z] . getSize  ( Function |Number, optional)  Default:  1 The height of each object, in units specified by  sizeUnits  (default pixels). If a number is provided, it is used as the size for all objects. If a function is provided, it is called on each object to retrieve its size. getColor  ( Function |Array, optional)  Default:  [0, 0, 0, 255] The rgba color is in the format of  [r, g, b, [a]] . Each channel is a number between 0-255 and  a  is 255 if not supplied. If an array is provided, it is used as the color for all objects. If a function is provided, it is called on each object to retrieve its color. If  mask  = false, only the alpha component will be used to control the opacity of the icon. getAngle  ( Function |Number, optional)  Default:  0 The rotating angle  of each object, in degrees. If a number is provided, it is used as the angle for all objects. If a function is provided, it is called on each object to retrieve its angle. getPixelOffset  ( Function |Array, optional)  Default:  [0, 0] Screen space offset relative to the  coordinates  in pixel unit. If an array is provided, it is used as the offset for all objects. If a function is provided, it is called on each object to retrieve its offset. Callbacks onIconError  (Function) Default:  null Only used when using auto-packing.

Use binary attributes This section is about the special requirements when  supplying attributes directly  to a  SolidPolygonLayer . Because each polygon has a different number of vertices, when  data.attributes.getPolygon  is supplied, the layer also requires an array  data.startIndices  that describes the vertex index at the start of each polygon. For example, if there are 3 polygons of 3, 4, and 5 vertices each (including the end vertex that overlaps with the first vertex to close the loop),  startIndices  should be  [0, 3, 7, 12] .  Polygons with holes are not supported when using precalculated attributes. Additionally, all other attributes ( getFillColor ,  getElevation , etc.), if supplied, must contain the same layout (number of vertices) as the  getPolygon  buffer. To truly realize the performance gain from using binary data, the app likely wants to skip all data processing in this layer. Specify the  _normalize  prop to skip normalization.

To draw a large number of hexagons efficiently, the  H3HexagonLayer  may choose to use instanced drawing by assuming that all hexagons within the current viewport have the same shape as the one at the center of the current viewport. The discrepancy is usually too small to be visible. There are several cases in which high-precision mode is required. In these cases,  H3HexagonLayer  may choose to switch to high-precision mode, where it trades performance for accuracy: The input set contains a pentagon. There are 12 pentagons world wide at each resolution, and these cells and their immediate neighbors have significant differences in shape. The input set is at a coarse resolution (res  0  through res  5 ). These cells have larger differences in shape, particularly when using a Mercator projection.

Installation To install the dependencies from NPM: To use pre-bundled scripts: Indexing System At each integer zoom level ( z ), the XY plane in the view space is divided into square tiles of the same size, each uniquely identified by their  x  and  y  index. When  z  increases by 1, the view space is scaled by 2, meaning that one tile at  z  covers the same area as four tiles at  z+1 . When the  TileLayer  is used with a geospatial view such as the  MapView , x, y, and z are determined from  the OSM tile index . When the  TileLayer  is used used with a non-geospatial view such as the  OrthographicView  or the  OrbitView ,  x  and  y  increment from the world origin, and each tile's width and height match that defined by the  tileSize  prop. For example, the tile  x: 0, y: 0  occupies the square between  [0, 0]  and  [tileSize, tileSize] . Properties Inherits all properties from  base  Layer .

Substrings  {x}   {y}  and  {z} , if present, will be replaced with a tile's actual index when it is requested. If the value is an array: multiple URL templates. Each endpoint must return the same content for the same tile index. This can be used to work around  domain sharding , allowing browsers to download more resources simultaneously. Requests made are balanced among the endpoints, based on the tile index. getTileData  (Function, optional) Default:  tile => load(tile.url) If supplied,  getTileData  is called to retrieve the data of each tile. It receives one argument  tile  which contains the following fields: x  (Number) - x index of the tile y  (Number) - y index of the tile z  (Number) - z index of the tile url  (String) - resolved url of the tile if the  data  prop is provided, otherwise  null bbox  (Object) - bounding box of the tile. When used with a geospatial view,  bbox  is in the shape of  {west: <longitude>, north: <latitude>, east: <longitude>, south: <latitude>} . When used with a non-geospatial view,  bbox  is in the shape of  {left, top, right, bottom} . signal  (Object) - an  AbortSignal  that may be signalled if there are too many queued requests. Note: only tiles that aren't visible will be aborted. It should return either the tile data or a Promise that resolves to the tile data. This prop is not required if  data  points to a supported format (JSON or image by default). Additional formats may be added by registering  loaders.gl  modules. It is recommended to pass  signal  to any  fetch  calls and check its  aborted  property before doing any expensive computation. If  signal  is aborted, then throw or return falsy from  getTileData  so the data is not cached; do not return incomplete data. If  signal  is aborted, but  getTileData  still returns a truthy response, then its data will be cached. tileSize  (Number, optional) The pixel dimension of the tiles, usually a power of 2. The tile size represents the target pixel width and height of each tile when rendered. Smaller tile sizes display the content at higher resolution, while the layer needs to load more tiles to fill the same viewport. Default:  512 maxZoom  (Number|Null, optional) Use tiles from this level when over-zoomed. Default:  null minZoom  (Number, optional) Hide tiles when under-zoomed. Default: 0 extent  (Array, optional) If provided, the layer will load and render the tiles in this box at  minZoom  when underzoomed (i.e.  zoom < minZoom ).  The box is of the form  [minX, minY, maxX, maxY] . If  null , the layer will not display any tiles when underzoomed to avoid issuing too many tile requests. Default: null maxCacheSize  (Number, optional) The maximum number of tiles that can be cached. The tile cache keeps loaded tiles in memory even if they are no longer visible. It reduces the need to re-download the same data over and over again when the user pan/zooms around the map, providing a smoother experience. If not supplied, the  maxCacheSize  is calculated as  5  times the number of tiles in the current viewport. Default:  null maxCacheByteSize  (Number, optional) The maximum memory used for caching tiles. If this limit is supplied,  getTileData  must return an object that contains a  byteLength  field. Default:  null refinementStrategy  (Enum, optional) How the tile layer refines the visibility of tiles. One of the following: 'best-available' : If a tile in the current viewport is waiting for its data to load, use cached content from the closest zoom level to fill the empty space. This approach minimizes the visual flashing due to missing content. 'no-overlap' : Avoid showing overlapping tiles when backfilling with cached content. This is usually favorable when tiles do not have opaque backgrounds. 'never' : Do not display any tile that is not selected. Default:  'best-available' maxRequests  (Number, optional) The maximum number of concurrent  getTileData  calls. If  <= 0 , no throttling will occur, and  getTileData  may be called an unlimited number of times concurrently regardless of how long that tile is or was visible. If  > 0 , a maximum of  maxRequests  instances of  getTileData  will be called concurrently. Requests may never be called if the tile wasn't visible long enough to be scheduled and started. Requests may also be aborted (through the  signal  passed to  getTileData ) if there are more than  maxRequests  ongoing requests and some of those are for tiles that are no longer visible. If  getTileData  makes  fetch  requests against an HTTP 1 web server, then  maxRequests  should correlate to the browser's maximum number of concurrent  fetch  requests. For Chrome, the max is 6 per domain. If you use the  data  prop and specify multiple domains, you can increase this limit. For example, with Chrome and 3 domains specified, you can set  maxRequests=18 . If the web server supports HTTP/2 (Open Chrome dev tools and look for \"h2\" in the Protocol column), then you can make an unlimited number of concurrent requests (and can set  maxRequests=-1 ). Note that this will request data for every tile, no matter how long the tile was visible, and may increase server load. Default:  6 Render Options renderSubLayers  (Function, optional) Renders one or an array of Layer instances with all the  TileLayer  props and the following props: id : An unique id for this sublayer data : Resolved from  getTileData . As of deck.gl 8.2, this prop is always the data resolved from the Promise and is never a Promise itself. tile : An object containing tile index  x ,  y ,  z , and  bbox  of the tile. Default:  props => new GeoJsonLayer(props) zRange  (Array, optional) An array representing the range of minimum and maximum heights in the tile. This is designed to support extruded layers, such as the TerrainLayer, ensuring the right tiles are loaded and rendered. This prop currently only has effect when used with a geospatial view. Default:  null  (interpreted as  [0, 0] ) modelMatrix  (Matrix4, optional) Affects both rendering and tile fetching to produce a transformed tile layer.  Note that this can result in tiles being fetched outside the  extent  prop, for example if the  modelMatrix  defines a rotation. Default:  null Callbacks onViewportLoad  (Function, optional) onViewportLoad  is a function that is called when all tiles in the current viewport are loaded. The loaded content (as returned by  getTileData ) for each visible tile is passed as an array to this callback function. Default:  data => null onTileLoad  (Function, optional) onTileLoad  called when a tile successfully loads. Default:  () => {} Receives arguments: tile  (Object) - the tile that has been loaded. onTileError  (Function, optional) onTileError  called when a tile failed to load. Default:  console.error Receives arguments: error  ( Error ) onTileUnload  (Function, optional) onTileUnload  called when a tile is cleared from cache. Default:  () => {} Receives arguments: tile  (Object) - the tile that has been cleared from cache.

It allows the layer to show/hide objects based on user-defined properties. This extension provides a significantly more performant alternative to filtering the data array on the CPU. Note: This extension does not work with all deck.gl layers. See \"limitations\" below. Installation To install the dependencies from NPM: To use pre-bundled scripts: Constructor filterSize  (Number) - the size of the filter (number of columns to filter by). The data filter can show/hide data based on 1-4 numeric properties of each object. Default  1 . fp64  (Boolean) - if  true , use 64-bit precision instead of 32-bit. Default  false . See the \"remarks\" section below for use cases and limitations. countItems  (Boolean) - if  true , reports the number of filtered objects with the  onFilteredItemsChange  callback. Default  false . Layer Properties When added to a layer via the  extensions  prop, the  DataFilterExtension  adds the following properties to the layer: getFilterValue  ( Function ) Called to retrieve the value for each object that it will be filtered by. Returns either a number (if  filterSize: 1 ) or an array. For example, consider data in the following format: To filter by timestamp: To filter by both timestamp and speed: Note that all filtered values are uploaded as 32-bit floating numbers, so certain values e.g. raw unix epoch time may not be accurately represented. You may test the validity of a timestamp by calling  Math.fround(t)  to check if there would be any loss of precision. filterRange  (Array) The bounds which defines whether an object should be rendered. If an object's filtered value is within the bounds, the object will be rendered; otherwise it will be hidden. This prop can be updated on user input or animation with very little cost. Format: If  filterSize  is  1 :  [min, max] If  filterSize  is  2  to  4 :  [[min0, max0], [min1, max1], ...]  for each filtered property, respectively. filterSoftRange  (Array, optional) Default:  null If specified, objects will be faded in/out instead of abruptly shown/hidden. When the filtered value is outside of the bounds defined by  filterSoftRange  but still within the bounds defined by  filterRange , the object will be rendered as \"faded.\" See  filterTransformSize  and  filterTransformColor  for additional control over this behavior. Format: If  filterSize  is  1 :  [softMin, softMax] If  filterSize  is  2  to  4 :  [[softMin0, softMax0], [softMin1, softMax1], ...]  for each filtered property, respectively. filterTransformSize  (Boolean, optional) Default:  true When an object is \"faded\", manipulate its size so that it appears smaller or thinner. Only works if  filterSoftRange  is specified. filterTransformColor  (Boolean, optional) Default:  true When an object is \"faded\", manipulate its opacity so that it appears more translucent. Only works if  filterSoftRange  is specified. filterEnabled  (Boolean, optional) Default:  true Enable/disable the data filter. If the data filter is disabled, all objects are rendered. onFilteredItemsChange  (Function, optional) Only used if the  countItems  option is enabled. Called with the following arguments when the filter changes: event  (Object) id  (String) - the id of the source layer. Note when this prop is specified on a  CompositeLayer , such as  GeoJsonLayer , the callback is called once by each sub layer. count  (Number) - the number of data objects that pass the filter. Remarks Filter precision By default, both the filter values and the filter range are uploaded to the GPU as 32-bit floats. When using very large filter values, most commonly Epoch timestamps, 32-bit float representation could lead to an error margin of >1 minute. Enabling 64-bit precision by setting  fp64: true  would allow the filter range to be evaluated more accurately. However, 64-bit support requires one extra attribute slot, which increases the risk of exceeding the hardware limit on vertex attributes. Depending on the layer that the  DataFilterExtension  is used with, it may interfere with the layer's ability to use other extensions. If this becomes an issue, an alternative technique is to transform each filter value by subtracting a fixed \"origin\" value, thus making the numbers smaller: 32-bit floats can accurately represent each second within ~190 days ( 2^24 ). Unless the filter values require both a large span and fine granularity, 32-bit floats should be sufficient. Limitations Given data filtering happens on GPU, not all layers of  @deck.gl/aggregation-layers  module, support this feature.

Note: In v8.0, the  getDashArray  and  dashJustified  props are removed from the  PathLayer  and moved into this extension. Installation To install the dependencies from NPM: To use pre-bundled scripts: Constructor dash  (Boolean) - add capability to render dashed lines. Default  false . highPrecisionDash  (Boolean) - improve dash rendering quality in certain circumstances. Note that this option introduces additional performance overhead, see \"Remarks\" below. Default  false . offset  (Boolean) - add capability to offset lines. Default  false . Layer Properties When added to a layer via the  extensions  prop, the  PathStyleExtension  adds the following properties to the layer: getDashArray  ( Function |Array) Must be specified if the  dash  option is enabled. The dash array to draw each path with:  [dashSize, gapSize]  relative to the width of the path. If an array is provided, it is used as the dash array for all paths. If a function is provided, it is called on each path to retrieve its dash array. Return  [0, 0]  to draw the path in solid line. If this accessor is not specified, all paths are drawn as solid lines. dashJustified  (Boolean, optional) Default:  false Only effective if  getDashArray  is specified. If  true , adjust gaps for the dashes to align at both ends. Overrides the effect of  highPrecisionDash . getOffset  ( Function |Number) Must be specified if the  offset  option is enabled. The offset to draw each path with, relative to the width of the path. Negative offset is to the left hand side, and positive offset is to the right hand side.  0  extrudes the path so that it is centered at the specified coordinates. If a number is provided, it is used as the offset for all paths. If a function is provided, it is called on each path to retrieve its offset. Remarks Limitations WebGL has guaranteed support for up to 16 attributes per shader. The current implementation of  PathLayer  uses 13 attributes. Each one of the options of this extension adds one more attribute. In other words, if all options are enabled, the layer will not be able to use other extensions. Tips on Rendering Dash Lines There are three modes to render dash lines with this extension: Default: dash starts from the beginning of each line segment Justified: dash is stretched to center on each line segment High precision: dash is evaluated continuously from the beginning of a path The above table illustrates the visual behavior of the three modes. The default mode works best if the data consists of long, disjoint paths. It renders dashes at exactly the defined lengths. The justified mode is guaranteed to render sharp, well-defined corners. This is great for rendering polyline shapes. However, the gap size may look inconsistent across line segments due to stretching. The high precision mode pre-calculates path length on the CPU, so it may be slower and use more resources for large datasets. When a path contains a lot of short segments, this mode yields the best result.

If you intend to implement a layer that generates other layers, you should extend this class. For more information consult the  Composite Layers  article. Usage Define a composite layer that renders a set of sublayers, one of them conditionally Constructor Parameters: props  (Object) -  Layer  properties. Properties Inherits from all  Base Layer  properties. _subLayerProps  (Object)  EXPERIMENTAL Key is the id of a sublayer and value is an object used to override the props of the sublayer. For a list of ids rendered by each composite layer, consult the  Sub Layers  section in each layer's documentation. Example: make only the point features in a GeoJsonLayer respond to hover and click Example: use IconLayer instead of ScatterplotLayer to render the point features in a GeoJsonLayer Members isComposite Always  true . isLoaded true  if all asynchronous assets are loaded, and all sublayers are also loaded. parent A  Layer  instance if this layer is rendered by a  CompositeLayer Methods draw A composite layer does not render directly into the WebGL context. The  draw  method inherited from the base class is therefore never called. renderLayers Allows a layer to \"render\" or insert one or more deck.gl layers after itself.\nCalled after a layer has been updated. Returns: null , a single  Layer  instance, or a (nested) array of layers. The default implementation of  renderLayers  returns  null . renderLayers  can return a nested arrays with  null  values. deck.gl will automatically flatten and filter the array. See usage above. getPickingInfo Called when a sublayer is being hovered or clicked, after the  getPickingInfo \nof the sublayer has been called.\nThe composite layer can override or add additional fields to the  info  object\nthat will be passed to the callbacks. Parameters: pickParams  (Object) pickParams.info  (Object) - The current  info  object. By default it contains the\nfollowing fields: x  (Number) - Mouse position x relative to the viewport. y  (Number) - Mouse position y relative to the viewport. coordinate  ( Number, Number ) - Mouse position in world coordinates. Only applies if the\n coordinateSystem \nprop is set to  COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT . color  (Number 4 ) - The color of the pixel that is being picked. It represents a\n\"picking color\" that is encoded by\n layer.encodePickingColor() . index  (Number) - The index of the object that is being picked. It is the returned\nvalue of\n layer.decodePickingColor() . picked  (Boolean) -  true  if  index  is not  -1 . pickParams.mode  (String) - One of  hover  and  click pickParams.sourceLayer  (Layer) - the sublayer instance where this event originates from. Returns: An  info  object with optional fields about what was picked. This object will be passed to the layer's  onHover  or  onClick  callbacks. null , if the corresponding event should be cancelled with no callback functions called. The default implementation returns  pickParams.info  without any change. getSubLayerProps This utility method helps create sublayers that properly inherit a composite layer's basic props. For example, it creates a unique id for the sublayer, and makes sure the sublayer's  coordinateSystem  is set to be the same as the parent. Parameters: subLayerProps  (Object) id  (String, required) - an id that is unique among all the sublayers generated by this composite layer. updateTriggers  (Object) - the sublayer's update triggers.

Parameters: id  (String) - the sublayer id data  (Array) - the sublayer data Returns  true  if the sublayer should be rendered. The base class implementation returns  true  if either  data  is not empty or the  _subLayerProps  prop contains override for this sublayer. getSubLayerClass Called to retrieve the constructor of a sublayer.\nA composite layer can override this method to change the default behavior. Parameters: id  (String) - the sublayer id DefaultLayerClass  - the default constructor used for this sublayer. Returns: Constructor for this sublayer.

If  event  is provided, returns  false  if the event is already handled, and mark the event as handled if the point is in bounds. This can be used to make sure that certain events are only handled by one controller, when there are overlapping viewports. isDragging() Returns  true  if the user is dragging the view. Event Handling A controller can specify a list of additional event names that this control subscribes to by adding them to the  events  field. Available events:  click ,  dblclick ,  tap ,  doubletap ,  press ,  pinch ,  pinchin ,  pinchout ,  pinchstart ,  pinchmove ,  pinchend ,  pinchcancel ,  rotate ,  rotatestart ,  rotatemove ,  rotateend ,  rotatecancel ,  pan ,  panstart ,  panmove ,  panup ,  pandown ,  panleft ,  panright ,  panend ,  pancancel ,  swipe ,  swipeleft ,  swiperight ,  swipeup ,  swipedown ,  pointerdown ,  pointermove ,  pointerup ,  touchstart ,  touchmove ,  touchend ,  mousedown ,  mousemove ,  mouseup ,  keydown , and  keyup . The following events are toggled on/off based on user options: scrollZoom  -  ['wheel'] dragPan  and  dragRotate  -  ['panstart', 'panmove', 'panend'] touchZoomRotate  -  ['pinchstart', 'pinchmove', 'pinchend'] doubleClickZoom  -  ['doubletap'] keyboar  -  ['keydown'] Event object is generated by  mjolnir.js . It always has the following properties: type  (string) -  The event type to which the event handler is subscribed, e.g.  'click'  or  'pointermove' center  (Object  {x, y} ) - The center of the event location (e.g. the centroid of a touch) relative to the viewport (basically,  clientX/Y ) offsetCenter  (Object  {x, y} ) - The center of the event location relative to the map. target  (Object) - The target of the event, as specified by the original  srcEvent srcEvent  (Object) - The original event object dispatched by the browser to the JS runtime Additionally, event objects for different event types contain a subset of the following properties: key  (number) - The keycode of the keyboard event leftButton  (boolean) - Flag indicating whether the left button is involved during the event middleButton  (boolean) - Flag indicating whether the middle button is involved during the event rightButton  (boolean) - Flag indicating whether the right button is involved during the event pointerType  (string) - A string indicating the type of input (e.g.  'mouse' ,  'touch' ,  'pointer' ) delta  (number) - The scroll magnitude/distance of a wheel event Source modules/core/src/controllers/controller.js","headings":[{"value":"Controller","depth":1},{"value":"Options","depth":2},{"value":"Methods","depth":2},{"value":"constructor","depth":5},{"value":"handleEvent(event)","depth":5},{"value":"setProps(props)","depth":5},{"value":"updateViewport(newMapState, extraProps, extraState)","depth":5},{"value":"getCenter(event)","depth":5},{"value":"isFunctionKeyPressed(event)","depth":5},{"value":"isPointInBounds(pos, [event])","depth":5},{"value":"isDragging()","depth":5},{"value":"Event Handling","depth":2},{"value":"Source","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/api-reference/core/controller","title":"Controller"},{"excerpt":"DeckGL (Scripting Interface) DeckGL  extends the core  Deck  class with some additional features such as Mapbox integration.

If you are using React, you should not use this component directly. Instead you should be rendering the  DeckGL  React Component . Usage Constructor Creates a new Deck instance. Parameters: See the  Properties  section. Properties width  (Number, required) Width of the canvas. height  (Number, required) Height of the canvas. layers  (Array, required) The array of deck.gl layers to be rendered. This array is expected to be an array of newly allocated instances of your deck.gl layers, created with updated properties derived from the current application state. layerFilter  (Function) Default:  null If supplied, will be called before a layer is drawn to determine whether it should be rendered. This gives the application an opportunity to filter out layers from the layer list during either rendering or picking. Filtering can be done per viewport or per layer or both. This enables techniques like adding helper layers that work as masks during picking but do not show up during rendering. Notes: layerFilter  does not override the visibility defined by the layer's  visible  and  pickable  props. All the lifecycle methods are still triggered even a if a layer is filtered out using this prop. Arguments: layer  (Layer) - the layer to be drawn viewport  (Viewport) - the current viewport isPicking  (Boolean) - whether this is a picking pass renderPass  (String) - the name of the current render pass. Some standard passes are: 'screen'  - drawing to screen 'picking:hover'  - drawing to offscreen picking buffer due to pointer move 'picking:query'  - drawing to offscreen picking buffer due to user-initiated query, e.g. calling  deck.pickObject . 'shadow'  - drawing to shadow map Returns: true  if the layer should be drawn. getCursor  (Function) A custom callback to retrieve the cursor type. Receives an  interactionState  object and returns a string that is a  CSS cursor . Default:  ({isDragging}) => isDragging ? 'grabbing' : 'grab' Remarks: It is worth noting that when supplying a custom image for the cursor icon, Chrome requires a fallback option to be supplied, otherwise the custom image will not be loaded; e.g.  getCursor={() => 'url(images/custom.png), auto'} views  (Array) A single  View , or an array of  View  instances (optionally mixed with  Viewport  instances, although the latter is deprecated). If not supplied, a single  MapView  will be created. If an empty array is supplied, no  View  will be shown. Remarks: During render and picking, deck.gl will render all the  View s in the supplied order, this can matter if they overlap. View s represent your \"camera(s)\" (essentially view and projection matrices, together with viewport width and height). By changing the  views  property you change the view of your layers. viewState  (Object) A geospatial  viewState  would typically contain the following fields: latitude  (Number, optional) - Current latitude - used to define a mercator projection if  viewport  is not supplied. longitude  (Number, optional) - Current longitude - used to define a mercator projection if  viewport  is not supplied. zoom  (Number, optional) - Current zoom - used to define a mercator projection if  viewport  is not supplied. bearing  (Number, optional) - Current bearing - used to define a mercator projection if  viewport  is not supplied. pitch  (Number, optional) - Current pitch - used to define a mercator projection if  viewport  is not supplied. Transitions between two viewState objects can also be achieved by providing set of fields to  viewState  prop, for more details check  ViewState Transitions ). initialViewState  (Object) If  initialViewState  is provided, the  Deck  component will track view state changes from any attached  controller  using internal state, with  initialViewState  as its initial view state. If the  initialViewState  prop changes, the internally tracked view state will be updated to match the new \"initial\" view state. Notes: The  props.onViewStateChange  callback will still be called, if provided. If  props.viewState  is supplied by the application, the supplied  viewState  will always be used, \"shadowing\" the  Deck  component's internal  viewState . In simple applications, use of the  initialViewState  prop can avoid the need to track the view state in the application. One drawback of using  initialViewState  for reactive/functional applications is that the  Deck  component becomes more stateful. controller  (Function | Boolean | Object) Options for viewport interactivity, e.g. pan, rotate and zoom with mouse, touch and keyboard. This is a shorthand for defining interaction with the  views  prop if you are using the default view (i.e. a single  MapView ). is equivalent to: controller  can be one of the following types: null  or  false : the viewport is not interactive. true : initiates the default controller - a  MapController , with default options. Controller  class (not instance): initiates the provided controller with default options. Must be a subclass of the  MapController . Object : controller options. This will be merged with the default controller options. controller.type : the controller class, must be a subclass of the  MapController . For other options, consult the documentation of  Controller . Default  null . effects  (Array) The array of effects to be rendered.A lighting effect will be added if an empty array is supplied.Refer to effect's documentation to see details LightingEffect Configuration Properties id  (String, optional) Canvas ID to allow style customization in CSS. style  (Object, optional) CSS styles for the deckgl-canvas. touchAction  (String, optional) Allow browser default touch actions. See  hammer.js doc . Default:  none . By default, the deck canvas captures all touch interactions. This prop is useful for mobile applications to unblock default scrolling behavior. For example, use the combination  controller: {dragPan: false}  and  touchAction: 'pan-y'  to allow vertical page scroll when dragging over the canvas. pickingRadius  (Number, optional) Extra pixels around the pointer to include while picking. This is helpful when rendered objects are difficult to target, for example irregularly shaped icons, small moving circles or interaction by touch. Default  0 . getTooltip  (Function, optional) Callback that takes a hovered-over point and renders a tooltip. If the prop is not specified, the tooltip is hidden. Callback arguments: info  - the  picking info  describing the object being hovered. If the callback returns  null , the tooltip is hidden, with the CSS  display  property set to  none .\nIf the callback returns a string, that string is rendered in a tooltip with the default CSS styling described below.\nOtherwise, the callback can return an object with the following fields: text  (String, optional) - Specifies the  innerText  attribute of the tooltip. html  (String, optional) - Specifies the  innerHTML  attribute of the tooltip. Note that this will override the specified  innerText . className  (String, optional) - Class name to attach to the tooltip element. The element has the default class name of  deck-tooltip . style  (Object, optional) - An object of CSS styles to apply to the tooltip element, which can override the default styling. By default, the tooltip has the following CSS style: useDevicePixels  (Boolean|Number, optional) Controls the resolution of drawing buffer used for rendering. true :  Device (physical) pixels  resolution is used for rendering, this resolution is defined by  window.devicePixelRatio . On Retina/HD systems this resolution is usually twice as big as  CSS pixels  resolution. false :  CSS pixels  resolution (equal to the canvas size) is used for rendering. Number  (Experimental): Specified Number is used as a custom ratio (drawing buffer resolution to  CSS pixel  resolution) to determine drawing buffer size, a value less than  one  uses resolution smaller than  CSS pixels , gives better performance but produces blurry images, a value greater than  one  uses resolution bigger than CSS pixels resolution (canvas size), produces sharp images but at a lower performance. Default value is  true . Note: Consider setting to  false  or to a Number less than  one  if better rendering performance is needed. When it is set to a high Number (like, 4 or more), it is possible to hit the system limit for allocating drawing buffer, such cases will log a warning and fallback to system allowed resolution. gl  (Object, optional) gl context, will be autocreated if not supplied. glOptions  (Object, optional) Additional options used when creating the WebGLContext. See  WebGL context attributes . _framebuffer  (Object, optional) (Experimental) Render to a custom frame buffer other than to screen. parameters  (Object, optional) Expects an object with WebGL settings. This object will be passed to luma.gl's  setParameters  function to configure the WebGL context, e.g. to disable depth testing, change blending modes etc. The  parameters  will be set before each frame is rendered. Naturally, any WebGL  parameters  prop supplied to individual layers will still override global parameters for that layer. To get access to static parameter values, applications can  import GL from 'luma.gl' . Please refer to the luma.gl  setParameters  API for documentation on supported parameters and values. An alternative way to set  parameters   is to instead define the  onWebGLInitialized  callback (it receives the  gl  context as parameter) and call the luma.gl  setParameters  method inside it. debug  (Boolean, optional) Flag to enable WebGL debug mode. Default value is  false . Notes: debug mode is slower as it will use synchronous operations to keep track of GPU state. Enabling debug mode also requires an extra luma.gl import: _animate  (Experimental) Forces deck.gl to redraw layers every animation frame. Normally deck.gl layers are only redrawn if any change is detected. Event Callbacks onWebGLInitialized  (Function, optional) Called once the WebGL context has been initiated. Callback arguments: gl  - the WebGL context. onViewStateChange  (Function) The  onViewStateChange  callback is fired when the user has interacted with the deck.gl canvas, e.g. using mouse, touch or keyboard. onViewStateChange({viewState, interactionState, oldViewState}) viewState  - An updated  view state  object. interactionState  - Describes the interaction that invoked the view state change. May include the following fields: inTransition  (Boolean) isDragging  (Boolean) isPanning  (Boolean) isRotating  (Boolean) isZooming  (Boolean) oldViewState  - The previous  view state  object. Returns: The application can return an updated view state. If a view state is returned, it will be used instead of the passed in  viewState  to update the application's internal view state (see  initialViewState ). onHover  (Function, optional) Called when the pointer moves over the canvas. Callback arguments: info  - the  picking info  describing the object being hovered. event  - the original gesture event onClick  (Function, optional) Called when clicking on the canvas. Callback arguments: info  - the  picking info  describing the object being clicked. event  - the original gesture event onDragStart  (Function, optional) Called when the user starts dragging on the canvas. Callback arguments: info  - the  picking info  describing the object being dragged. event  - the original gesture event onDrag  (Function, optional) Called when dragging the canvas. Callback arguments: info  - the  picking info  describing the object being dragged. event  - the original gesture event onDragEnd  (Function, optional) Called when the user releases from dragging the canvas. Callback arguments: info  - the  picking info  describing the object being dragged. event  - the original gesture event onLoad  (Function, optional) Called once after gl context and Deck components ( ViewManager ,  LayerManager , etc) are created. It is safe to trigger viewport transitions after this event. onResize  (Function, optional) Called when the canvas resizes. Callback arguments: size width  (Number) - the new width of the deck canvas, in client pixels height  (Number) - the new height of the deck canvas, in client pixels onBeforeRender  (Function, optional) Called just before the canvas rerenders. Callback arguments: gl  - the WebGL context. onAfterRender  (Function, optional) Called right after the canvas rerenders. Callback arguments: gl  - the WebGL context. onError  (Function, optional) Called if deck.gl encounters an error. By default, deck logs the error to console and attempt to continue rendering the rest of the scene. Callback arguments: error  ( Error ) source  - the source of the error, likely a Layer instance _onMetrics  (Function, optional)  Experimental Called once every second with performance metrics. Callback argument is an object with fields specified  here . Methods finalize Frees resources associated with this object immediately (rather than waiting for garbage collection). deck.finalize() setProps Updates properties. See the Properties section on this page for more detail on which props can be set. redraw Attempt to draw immediately, rather than waiting for the next draw cycle. By default, deck flushes all changes to the canvas on each animation frame. This behavior might cause the deck canvas to fall out of sync with other components if synchronous updates are required. Redrawing frequently outside of rAF may cause performance problems. Only use this method if the render cycle must be managed manually. force  (Boolean) - if  false , only redraw if necessary (e.g. changes have been made to views or layers). If  true , skip the check. Default  false . pickObject Get the closest pickable and visible object at the given screen coordinate. x  (Number) - x position in pixels y  (Number) - y position in pixels radius  (Number, optional) - radius of tolerance in pixels. Default  0 . layerIds  (Array, optional) - a list of layer ids to query from. If not specified, then all pickable and visible layers are queried. unproject3D  (Boolean, optional) - if  true ,  info.coordinate  will be a 3D point by unprojecting the  x, y  screen coordinates onto the picked geometry. Default  false . Returns: a single  info  object, or  null  if nothing is found. pickMultipleObjects Performs deep picking. Finds all close pickable and visible object at the given screen coordinate, even if those objects are occluded by other objects. x  (Number) - x position in pixels y  (Number) - y position in pixels radius = 0  (Number, optional) - radius of tolerance in pixels. layerIds = null  (Array, optional) - a list of layer ids to query from. If not specified, then all pickable and visible layers are queried. depth = 10  - Specifies the max unproject3D  (Boolean, optional) - if  true ,  info.coordinate  will be a 3D point by unprojecting the  x, y  screen coordinates onto the picked geometry. Default  false . Returns: An array of  info  objects. The array will be empty if no object was picked. Notes: Deep picking is implemented as a sequence of simpler picking operations and can have a performance impact. Should this become a concern, you can use the  depth  parameter to limit the number of matches that can be returned, and thus the maximum number of picking operations. pickObjects Get all pickable and visible objects within a bounding box. Parameters: x  (Number) - left of the bounding box in pixels y  (Number) - top of the bouding box in pixels width  (Number, optional) - width of the bouding box in pixels. Default  1 . height  (Number, optional) - height of the bouding box in pixels. Default  1 . layerIds  (Array, optional) - a list of layer ids to query from. If not specified, then all pickable and visible layers are queried. Returns: an array of unique  info  objects Notes: The query methods are designed to quickly find objects by utilizing the picking buffer. The query methods offer more flexibility for developers to handle events compared to the built-in hover and click callbacks. Member Variables metrics A map of various performance statistics for the last 60 frames of rendering. Metrics gathered in deck.gl are the following: 'fps': average number of frames rendered per second 'updateAttributesTime': time spent updating layer attributes 'setPropsTime': time spent setting deck properties 'framesRedrawn': number of times the scene was rendered 'pickTime': total time spent on picking operations 'pickCount': number of times a pick operation was performed 'gpuTime': total time spent on GPU processing 'gpuTimePerFrame': average time spent on GPU processing per frame 'cpuTime': total time spent on CPU processing 'cpuTimePerFrame': average time spent on CPU processing per frame 'bufferMemory': total GPU memory allocated for buffers 'textureMemory': total GPU memory allocated for textures 'renderbufferMemory': total GPU memory allocated for renderbuffers 'gpuMemory': total allocated GPU memory Remarks Since deck.gl is based on WebGL and uses a single WebGL context, it can only render into a single canvas. Thus all its  View s will render into the same canvas (unless you use multiple DeckGL instances, but that can have significant resource and performance impact).

Use with caution and report any issues that you find on GitHub. The  GlobeView  class is a subclass of  View . This view projects the earth into a 3D globe. It's recommended that you read the  Views and Projections guide  before using this class. Limitations The goal of  GlobeView  is to provide a generic solution to rendering and navigating data in the 3D space.\nIn the initial release, this class mainly addresses the need to render an overview of the entire globe. The following limitations apply, as features are still under development:  No support for rotation ( pitch  or  bearing ). The camera always points towards the center of the earth, with north up. No high-precision rendering at high zoom levels (> 12). Features at the city-block scale may not be rendered accurately. Only supports  COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT  (default of the  coordinateSystem  prop). Known rendering issues when using multiple views mixing  GlobeView  and  MapView , or switching between the two. Support for  TileLayer  and  MVTLayer  is experimental. These layers currently do not work in this view: Aggregation layers:  HeatmapLayer ,  ContourLayer TerrainLayer When GeoJson paths and polygons are rendered with this view, the straight lines and flat surfaces are warped to the surface of the globe. Note that the warped edges still correspond to straight lines in the Mercator projection. To draw lines along the shortest distance on the globe, use the  GreatCircleLayer . Constructor GlobeView  takes the same parameters as the  View  superclass constructor, plus the following: resolution  ( Number , optional) - the resolution at which to turn flat features into 3D meshes, in degrees. Smaller numbers will generate more detailed mesh. Default  10 . View State To render,  GlobeView  needs to be used together with a  viewState  with the following parameters: longitude  ( Number ) - longitude at the viewport center latitude  ( Number ) - latitude at the viewport center zoom  ( Number ) - zoom level maxZoom  ( Number , optional) - max zoom level. Default  20 . minZoom  ( Number , optional) - min zoom level. Default  0 . Additional projection matrix arguments: nearZMultiplier  (Number, optional) - Scaler for the near plane, 1 unit equals to the height of the viewport. Default to  0.1 . farZMultiplier  (Number, optional) - Scaler for the far plane, 1 unit equals to the distance from the camera to the edge of the screen. Default to  2 .

Static Members layerName  (String, required) This static property should contain the name of the layer, typically the name of layer's class (it cannot reliably be autodeduced in minified code). It is used as the default Layer id as well as for debugging and profiling. defaultProps  (Object, optional) All deck.gl layers define a  defaultProps  static member listing their props and default values. Using  defaultProps  improves both the code readability and performance during layer instance construction. Constructor Parameters: props  (Object) -  Layer  properties. Notes: More than one property object can be supplied. Property objects will be merged with the same semantics as  Object.assign , i.e. props in later objects will overwrite props earlier object. Every layer specifies default values for all its props, and these values will be used internally if that prop is not specified by the application in the Layer constructor. Properties Basic Properties id  (String, optional) Default: the layer class's  layerName  static property. The  id  must be unique among all your layers at a given time. The default value of  id  is the  Layer 's \"name\". If more than one instance of a specific type of layer exist at the same time, they must possess different  id  strings for deck.gl to properly distinguish them. Remarks: id  is used to match layers between rendering calls. deck.gl requires each layer to have a unique  id . A default  id  is assigned based on layer type, which means if you are using more than one layer of the same type (e.g. two  ScatterplotLayer s) you need to provide a custom  id  for at least one of them. A layer's name is defined by the  Layer.layerName  static member, or inferred from the constructor name (which is not robust in minified code). For sublayers (automatically generated by composite layers), a unique \"composite layer id\" is automatically generated by appending the sub layer's id to the parent layer's  id , so there is no risk of  id  collisions for sublayers, as long as the application's layer names are unique. data  (Iterable | String | Promise | AsyncIterable | Object, optional) Default:  [] deck.gl layers typically expect  data  to be one of the following types: Array : a JavaScript array of data objects. An object that implements the  iterable protocol , for example  Map  and  Set . Represents a collection of data objects. Any non-iterable object that contains a  length  field. deck.gl will not attempt to interpret its format, but simply call each accessor  length  times. (See remark below) String : an URL pointing to the data source. deck.gl will attempt to fetch the remote content and parse it as JSON. The resulting object is then used as the value of the  data  prop. Promise : the resolved value will be used as the value of the  data  prop. AsyncIterable : an  async iterable  object that yields data in batches. The default implementation expects each batch to be an array of data objects; one may change this behavior by supplying a custom  dataTransform  callback. data.attributes When using a non-iterable  data  object, the object may optionally contain a field  attributes , if the application wishes to supply binary buffers directly to the layer. This use case is discussed in detail in the  performance developer guide . The keys in  data.attributes  correspond to the  accessor  name that the binary should replace, for example  getPosition ,  getColor . See each layer's documentation for available accessor props. Each value in  data.attributes  may be one of the following formats: luma.gl  Buffer  instance A typed array, which will be used to create a  Buffer An object containing the following optional fields. For more information, see  WebGL vertex attribute API . buffer  ( Buffer ) value  (TypedArray) type  (GLenum) - A WebGL data type, see  vertexAttribPointer . size  (Number) - the number of elements per vertex attribute. offset  (Number) - offset of the first vertex attribute into the buffer, in bytes stride  (Number) - the offset between the beginning of consecutive vertex attributes, in bytes normalized  (Boolean) - whether data values should be normalized. Note that all color attributes in deck.gl layers are normalized by default. Remarks Some layers may accept alternative data formats. For example, the  GeoJsonLayer  supports any valid GeoJSON object as  data . These exceptions, if any, are documented in each layer's documentation. When an iterable value is passed to  data , every accessor function receives the current element as the first argument. When a non-iterable value (any object with a  length  field) is passed to  data , the accessor functions are responsible of interpreting the data format. The latter is often used with binary inputs. Read about this in  accessors . The automatic URL loading support is intended as a convenience for simple use cases. There are many limitations, including control over request parameters and headers, ability to parse non-JSON data, control of post-processing, CORS support etc. In such cases, it is always possible to load data using traditional JavaScript techniques and rerender the layer with the resulting data array. For  Layer  writers: Even though applications can pass in url string as  data  props, deck.gl makes sure that the layers never see  data  props containing  String  values. Layers will only see the default empty array value for the  data  prop until the data is loaded, at which point it will be updated with the loaded array. visible  (Boolean, optional) Default:  true Whether the layer is visible. Under most circumstances, using  visible  prop to control the visibility of layers are recommended over doing conditional rendering. Compare: with In the second example (conditional rendering) the layer state will be destroyed and regenerated every time the  showMyLayer  flag changes. opacity  (Number, optional) Default:  1 The opacity of the layer. Remarks: deck.gl automatically applies gamma to the opacity in an attempt to make opacity changes appear linear (i.e. the perceived opacity is visually proportional to the value of the prop). While it is a recommended convention that all deck.gl layers should support the  opacity  prop, it is up to each layer's fragment shader to properly implement support for opacity. extensions  (Array, optional) Add additional functionalities to this layer. See the  list of available extensions . Interaction Properties Layers can be interacted with using these properties. pickable  (Boolean, optional) Default:  false Whether the layer responds to mouse pointer picking events. onHover  (Function, optional) This callback will be called when the mouse enters/leaves an object of this deck.gl layer with the following parameters: info event  - the source event If this callback returns a truthy value, the  hover  event is marked as handled and will not bubble up to the  onHover  callback of the  DeckGL  canvas. Requires  pickable  to be true. onClick  (Function, optional) This callback will be called when the mouse clicks over an object of this deck.gl layer with the following parameters: info event  - the source event If this callback returns a truthy value, the  click  event is marked as handled and will not bubble up to the  onClick  callback of the  DeckGL  canvas. Requires  pickable  to be true. onDragStart  (Function, optional) This callback will be called when the mouse starts dragging an object of this deck.gl layer with the following parameters: info event  - the source event If this callback returns a truthy value, the  dragstart  event is marked as handled and will not bubble up to the  onDragStart  callback of the  DeckGL  canvas. Requires  pickable  to be true. onDrag  (Function, optional) This callback will be called when the mouse drags an object of this deck.gl layer with the following parameters: info event  - the source event If this callback returns a truthy value, the  drag  event is marked as handled and will not bubble up to the  onDrag  callback of the  DeckGL  canvas. Requires  pickable  to be true. onDragEnd  (Function, optional) This callback will be called when the mouse releases an object of this deck.gl layer with the following parameters: info event  - the source event If this callback returns a truthy value, the  dragend  event is marked as handled and will not bubble up to the  onDragEnd  callback of the  DeckGL  canvas. Requires  pickable  to be true. highlightColor  (Array|Function, optional) Default:  [0, 0, 128, 128] RGBA color to blend with the highlighted object (either the hovered over object if  autoHighlight: true , or the object at the index specified by  highlightedObjectIndex ). When the value is a 3 component (RGB) array, a default alpha of 255 is applied. If an array is supplied, it is used for the object that is currently highlighted. If a function is supplied, it is called with a  pickingInfo  object when the hovered object changes. The return value is used as the highlight color for the picked object. Only works with  autoHighlight: true . highlightedObjectIndex  (Integer, optional) Default:  -1 When provided a valid value corresponding object (one instance in instanced rendering or group of primitives with same picking color) will be highlighted with  highlightColor . autoHighlight  (Boolean, optional) Default:  false When true, current object pointed by mouse pointer (when hovered over) is highlighted with  highlightColor . Requires  pickable  to be true. Coordinate System Properties Normally only used when the application wants to work with coordinates that are not Web Mercator projected longitudes/latitudes. coordinateSystem  (Number, optional) Specifies how layer positions and offsets should be geographically interpreted. The default is to interpret positions as latitude and longitude, however it is also possible to interpret positions as meter offsets added to projection center specified by the  coordinateOrigin  prop. See the article on  Coordinate Systems  for details. coordinateOrigin  ( Number, Number , optional) Required when the  coordinateSystem  is set to  COORDINATE_SYSTEM.METER_OFFSETS . Specifies a longitude and a latitude from which meter offsets are calculated. See the article on  Coordinate Systems  for details. wrapLongitude  (Boolean, optional) Automatically wraps longitudes over the 180th antimeridian. When enabled on  PathLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  GeoJsonLayer , the paths/polygons are interpretted such that the connection between any two neighboring vertices is drawn on the shorter side of the world, and split into two if it crosses the 180th meridian. Note that this introduces CPU overhead at runtime. When working with static data, it is recommend that you preprocess the features offline instead of using this option. When enabled on other layers, the effect is applied per vertex by dynamically moving the antimeridian the furthest away from the current center of the viewport. It is most useful when viewing local data that cross the 180th meridian. Default  false . modelMatrix  (Number 16 , optional) An optional 4x4 matrix that is multiplied into the affine projection matrices used by shader  project  GLSL function and the Viewport's  project  and  unproject  JavaScript function. Allows local coordinate system transformations to be applied to a layer, which is useful when composing data from multiple sources that use different coordinate systems. Note that the matrix projection is applied after the non-linear mercator projection calculations are resolved, so be careful when using model matrices with longitude/latitude encoded coordinates. They normally work best with non-mercator viewports or meter offset based mercator layers. Data Properties There are a number of additional properties that provide extra control over data iteration, comparison and update. dataComparator  (Function, optional) This prop causes the  data  prop to be compared using a custom comparison function. The comparison function is called with the old data and the new data objects, and is expected to return true if they compare equally. Used to override the default shallow comparison of the  data  object. As an illustration, the app could set this to e.g. 'lodash.isequal', enabling deep comparison of the data structure. This particular examples would obviously have considerable performance impact and should only be used as a temporary solution for small data sets until the application can be refactored to avoid the need. The function receives two arguments: newData  - the new data prop oldData  - the data prop before the update And should return  true  if the two values are considered equal (no update needed), or  false  if the data has changed. dataTransform  (Function, optional) Executed to manipulate remote data when it's fetched. This callback applies when  data  is assigned a value that is either string (URL), Promise or an async iterable. The function receives two arguments: data  - the newly fetched data previousData  - (only available when  data  is an async iterable) the previously loaded data. If  dataTransform  is not supplied, the new data chunk is appended to the previous data array. And must return a valid  data  object: an array, an iterable or a non-iterable object that contains a  length  field. See documentation of the  data  prop for details. _dataDiff  (Function, optional)  Experimental This function is called when the data changes, either shallowly when  dataComparator  is not supplied or because  dataComparator  returns  false , to retrieve the indices of the changed objects. By default, when data changes, the attributes of all objects are recalculated. If this prop is supplied, only the attributes of the specified objects will be updated. This can lead to significant performance improvement if a few rows in a large data table need to change frequently: The function receives two arguments: newData  - the new data prop oldData  - the data prop before the update And is expected to return an array of \"ranges\", in the form of  {startRow, endRow} : startRow  (Number) - the beginning index of a changed chunk in the new data. endRow  (Number) - the end index of a changed chunk in the new data (excluded). This feature is experimental and intended for advanced use cases.  Note that it only rewrites part of a buffer, not remove or insert, therefore the user of this prop is responsible of making sure that all the unchanged objects remain at the same indices between  oldData  and  newData . This becomes trickier when dealing with data of dynamic lengths, for example  PathLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  GeoJsonLayer . Generally speaking, it is not recommended to use this feature when the count of vertices in the paths/polygons may change. positionFormat  (String, optional) One of  'XYZ' ,  'XY' . This prop is currently only effective in  PathLayer ,  SolidPolygonLayer  and  PolygonLayer . Default  'XYZ' . colorFormat  (String, optional) One of  'RGBA' ,  'RGB' . Setting it to  'RGB'  will make the layer ignore the alpha channel of the colors returned by accessors, and instead assume all objects to be opaque.\nThe layer's overall transparency controlled by  opacity  is still applied. Default  'RGBA' . numInstances  (Number, optional) deck.gl automatically derives the number of drawing instances from the  data  prop by counting the number of objects in  data . However, the developer might want to manually override it using this prop. updateTriggers  (Object, optional) Accessors such as  getColor  and  getPosition  are called to retrieve colors and positions when a layer is first added. From then on, to maximize performance, deck.gl does not recalculate colors or positions unless the  data  prop changes by shallow comparison. Sometimes  data  remains the same, but the outcome of an accessor has changed. In the following example, this is caused by changes in the external values  maleColor  and  femaleColor : In this case, you need to explicitly inform deck.gl to re-evaluate  getFillColor  for all data items. You do so by defining  updateTriggers : updateTriggers  expect an object whose keys are names of accessor props of this layer, and values are one or more variables that affect the output of the accessors. For example,  updateTriggers.getFillColor  is a list of variables that affect the output of\n  getFillColor . If either value in the array changes, all attributes that depend on\n  getFillColor  will be updated.\nThe variables may be numbers, strings, objects or functions. During each rendering cycle, deck.gl shallow-compares them with the previous values. Note: change of the  data  prop has higher priority than the  updateTriggers . If the app supplies a new  data  object, then all attributes will be automatically updated, even if the updateTriggers have not changed. To block excessive attribute updates, set the  dataComparator  prop. loadOptions  (Object, optional) Default:  null Layers use  loaders.gl  to load data and other resources.  loadOptions  is an object to customize the behavior of any loader used during fetching and parsing. The object may contain any of the  top-level options , as well as loader-specific options targeting a particular format. For example, the following prop value passes additional configs to the  fetch  call in order to access a secured API: The following code adds the  CSVLoader  to support CSV files: Layers may also include specialized loaders for their own use case, such as images, 3d-tiles, etc. See the documentation of each layer for additional load options that are available. onDataLoad  (Function, optional) Called when remote data is fully loaded. This callback applies when  data  is assigned a value that is either string (URL), Promise or an async iterable. The function receives two arguments: value  - the loaded data context  (Object) layer  - the current layer Render Properties parameters  (Function, optional) The  parameters  allows applications to specify values for WebGL parameters such as blending mode, depth testing etc. Any  parameters  will be applied temporarily while rendering this layer only. To get access to static parameter values, applications can  import GL from 'luma.gl' . Please refer to the luma.gl  setParameters  API for documentation on supported parameters and values. getPolygonOffset  (Function, optional) Default:  ({layerIndex}) => [0, -layerIndex * 100] When multiple layers are rendered on the same plane,  z-fighting  may create undesirable artifacts. To improve the visual quality of composition, deck.gl allows layers to use  gl.polygonOffset  to apply an offset to its depth. By default, each layer is offset a small amount by its index so that layers are cleanly stacked from bottom to top. This accessor takes a single parameter  uniform  - an object that contains the current render uniforms, and returns an array of two numbers  factor  and  units . Negative values pull layer towards the camera, and positive values push layer away from the camera. For more information, refer to the  documentation  and  FAQ . If the accessor is assigned a falsy value, polygon offset will be set to  [0, 0] . Remarks: While this feature helps mitigate z-fighting, at close up zoom levels the issue might return because of the precision error of 32-bit projection matrices. Try set the  fp64  prop to  true  in this case. transitions  (Object, optional) Default:  {} When creating layers, animation can be enabled by supplying an  transitions  prop. Animation parameters are defined per attribute by using attribute names or accessor names as keys: Each accessor name is mapped to an object that is the transition setting. The object may contain the following fields: Key Type Default Description type String 'interpolation' Type of the transition (either  'interpolation'  or  'spring' ) enter Function APPEARANCE ( value => value ) Callback to get the value that the entering vertices are transitioning from. See notes below onStart Function null Callback when the transition is started onEnd Function null Callback when the transition is done onInterrupt Function null Callback when the transition is interrupted Additional fields for  type: 'interpolation' : Key Type Default Description duration Number 0 Duration of the transition animation, in milliseconds easing Function LINEAR ( t => t ) Easing function that maps a value from  0, 1  to  0, 1 , see  http://easings.net/ Additional fields for  type: 'spring' : Key Type Default Description stiffness Number 0.05 \"Tension\" factor for the spring damping Number 0.5 \"Friction\" factor that counteracts the spring's acceleration Notes: As a shorthand, if an accessor key maps to a number rather than an object, then the number is assigned to the  duration  parameter, and an  interpolation  transition is used. Attribute transition is performed between the values at the same index. If the new data is larger,  enter  callback is called for each new vertex to backfill the values to transition from. enter  should return the value to transition from. for the current vertex. It receives two arguments: toValue  (TypedArray) - the new value to transition to, for the current vertex fromChunk  (Array | TypedArray) - the existing value to transition from, for the chunk that the current vertex belongs to. A \"chunk\" is a group of vertices that help the callback determine the context of this transition. For most layers, all objects are in one chunk. For PathLayer and PolygonLayer, each path/polygon is a chunk. Members Layer members are designed to support the creation of new layers or layer sub-classing and are NOT intended to be used by applications. context  (Object) The context object stores information that are shared by all layers. gl  ( WebGLRenderingContext ) - WebGL context of the current canvas. viewport  ( Viewport ) - The current viewport deck  ( Deck ) - The current deck.gl instance state  (Object) The state object allows a layer to store persistent information cross rendering cycles. attributeManager  ( AttributeManager ) - The attribute manager of this layer. props  (Object) Properties  of this layer. Members isLoaded true  if all asynchronous assets are loaded. parent A  Layer  instance if this layer is rendered by a  CompositeLayer Methods Layer methods are designed to support the creation of new layers or layer sub-classing and are NOT intended to be called by applications. General Methods clone Create a copy of this layer, optionally change some prop values. Arguments: overrideProps  (Object, optional) - layer props to update. setState Used to update the layers  state  object. Calling this method will also cause the layer to rerender. setModuleParameters Used to update the settings of shader modules. Layer Lifecycle Methods For more information about when these methods are called, see  layer lifecycle . initializeState This method is called only once for each layer to set up the initial state. initializeState(context) context  - The layer context is supplied as a parameter context.gl  ( WebGLRenderingContext ) - gl context ... deck.gl will already have created the  state  object at this time, and added the  gl  context and the  attributeManager  state. shouldUpdateState Called during each rendering cycle when layer  properties  or  context  has been updated and before layers are drawn. shouldUpdateState({props, oldProps, context, changeFlags}) Parameters: props  (Object) - Layer properties from the current rendering cycle. oldProps  (Object) - Layer properties from the previous rendering cycle. context  (Object) - Layer context from the current rendering cycle. changeFlags : an object that contains the following boolean flags: dataChanged ,  propsChanged ,  viewportChanged ,  somethingChanged ,  propsOrDataChanged ,  stateChanged ,  updateTriggersChanged ,  viewportChanged Returns: true  this layer needs to be updated. Remarks: Prop change is determined by shallow comparison. Data change is determined by shallow comparison of  props.data  unless  dataComparator  is supplied. The default implementation returns  true  if any change has been detected in data or props, but  ignores viewport changes . updateState Called when a layer needs to be updated. updateState({props, oldProps, context, changeFlags}) Parameters: props  (Object) - Layer properties from the current rendering cycle. oldProps  (Object) - Layer properties from the previous rendering cycle. context  (Object) - Layer context from the current rendering cycle. changeFlags : an object that contains the following boolean flags: dataChanged ,  propsChanged ,  viewportChanged ,  somethingChanged ,  propsOrDataChanged ,  stateChanged ,  updateTriggersChanged ,  viewportChanged The default implementation will invalidate all attributeManager attributes if the  data  prop has changed. draw Called on a layer to render to the WebGL canvas. draw({moduleParameters, uniforms, ..., context}) Parameters: uniforms : an object that contains all the  default unforms  to be passed to the shaders. context  - The layer context is supplied as a parameter context.gl  ( WebGLRenderingContext ) - gl context ... The default implementation looks for a variable  model  in the layer's state (which is expected to be an instance of the luma.gl  Model  class) and calls  draw  on that model with the parameters. getPickingInfo Called when a layer is being hovered or clicked, before any user callbacks are called. The layer can override or add additional fields to the  info  object that will be passed to the callbacks. Parameters: pickParams  (Object) pickParams.info  (Object) - The current  info  object. By default it contains the\nfollowing fields: x  (Number) - Mouse position x relative to the viewport. y  (Number) - Mouse position y relative to the viewport. coordinate  ( Number, Number ) - Mouse position in world coordinates. Only applies if  coordinateSystem  is  COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT . color  (Number 4 ) - The color of the pixel that is being picked. It represents a \"picking color\" that is encoded by  layer.encodePickingColor() . index  (Number) - The index of the object that is being picked. It is the returned value of  layer.decodePickingColor() . picked  (Boolean) -  true  if  index  is not  -1 . pickParams.mode  (String) - One of  hover  and  click Returns: An  info  object with optional fields about what was picked. This object will be passed to the layer's  onHover  or  onClick  callbacks. null , if the corresponding event should cancelled with no callback functions called. The default implementation populates the  info.object  field with the  info.index  element from the layer's  data  prop. finalizeState This method is called before the layer is being removed. A layer should release all resources created during its life span. Layer Projection Methods While most projection is handled \"automatically\" in the layers vertex shader, it is occasionally useful to be able to work in the projected coordinates in JavaScript while calculating uniforms etc. project Projects a map coordinate to screen coordinate, using the current viewport settings and the current coordinate system. Parameters: coordinates  (Array) -  [x, y, z]  in this layer's coordinate system. Returns: A screen coordinates array  [x, y]  or  [x, y, z]  if an altitude was given. unproject Unprojects a screen coordinate using the current viewport settings. Parameters: pixels  (Array) -  [x, y, z]  Passing a  z  is optional. Returns: A map coordinates array  [lng, lat]  or  [lng, lat, altitude]  if a  z  was given. projectPosition Projects a map coordinate to world coordinate using the current viewport settings and the current coordinate system. Can be useful to calculate world space angle and distances. Parameters: coordinates  (Array) -  [x, y, z]  in this layer's coordinate system. Returns: World coordinates in  [x, y] . Layer Picking Methods For the usage of these methods, see  how picking works . decodePickingColor Converts a color to a \"sub-feature index\" number.\nThis color is encoded by the  layer.encodePickingColor()  method. Parameters: color  (Array) - The color to be decoded in  [r, g, b] . Returns: A number representing the index of the feature. The null picking color (See  Layer.nullPickingColor ) will be decoded as -1. Note: The null picking color is returned when a pixel is picked that is not covered by the layer, or when the layer has selected to render a pixel using the null picking color to make it unpickable. encodePickingColor Converts a \"sub-feature index\" number to a color. This color can later be decoded by the  layer.decodePickingColor()  method. Parameters: index  (Integer) - The index to be encoded. Returns: An array of  [r, g, b] . To get a color that does not correspond to any sub-feature, use  layer.nullPickingColor() . Notes: indices to be encoded must be integers larger than or equal to 0. Picking colors are 24 bit values and can thus encode up to 16 million indices. nullPickingColor Returns: a \"null\" picking color which is equal the color of pixels not covered by the layer. This color is guaranteed not to match any index value greater than or equal to zero.

It makes it easy to write shaders that support all of deck.gl's projection modes and it supports some advanced rendering techniques such as pixel space rendering etc. The  project  module has two extensions: project32  shorthand functions for projecting directly from worldspace to clipspace. project64  counterpart of  project32  that enables 64 bit projections, providing an increase in precision, at the cost of performance. Usage Projects worldspace coordinates to clipspace coordinates. getUniforms The JavaScript uniforms are extracted from both contextual and per-layer props. The following information are used: viewport devicePixelRatio coordinateSystem coordinateOrigin modelMatrix GLSL Uniforms Uniforms are considered private to each shader module. They may change in between patch releases. Always use documented functions instead of accessing module uniforms directly. The uniforms of the  project  shader module are prefixed with  project_  in their names. GLSL Functions The projection module makes it easy to write vertex shaders that follow deck.gl's projection methods, enabling your layer to accept coordinates in both  longitude,latitude,altitude  or  metersX,metersY,metersZ  format. To support the basic features expected of a deck.gl layer, such as various viewport types and coordinate systems, your own shaders should always use the built-in projection functions. The functions converts positions/vectors between 4 coordinate spaces: Name Short Name Description World space world The  coordinate system  defined by the layer, not necessarily linear or uniform. Common space common A normalized intermediate 3D space that deck.gl uses for consistent processing of geometries, guaranteed to be linear and uniform. Therefore, it is safe to add/rotate/scale positions and vectors in this space. Screen space pixel Top-left coordinate system runs from  [0, 0]  to  [viewportWidth, viewportHeight]  (see remarks below). Clip space clipspace Output of the vertex shader. The GLSL functions of the  project  shader module uses the following naming convention: source_space : the short name of the coordinate space of the input. If not specified, the input is always in the  world  space. object_type : one of the following position : absolute position of a point offset : the delta between two positions normal : the normal vector of a surface size : the measurement of a geometry. This is different from  offset  in that  size  is uniform on all axes (e.g.  x, y, z  in meters in  LNGLAT  world space) and  offset  may not be (e.g.  dLon, dLat, dAlt  in degrees, degrees, and meters respectively in  LNGLAT  world space). target_space : the short name of the coordinate space of the output. If not specified, the output is always in the  common  space. project_position Converts the coordinates of a point from the world space to the common space. The coordinates are interpreted according to  coordinateSystem  and  modelMatrix  is applied. project_size Converts the size of a geometry from the world space (meters if geospatial, and absolute units otherwise) to the common space. project_size_to_pixel Converts the size of a geometry from the world space (meters if geospatial, and absolute units otherwise) to the common space. The result corresponds to the number of screen pixels when the given size is viewed with a top-down camera. project_pixel_size Converts the size of a geometry from the screen space to the common space. project_pixel_size_to_clipspace Converts the size of a geometry from the screen space to the clip space. project_normal Converts position deltas from the world space to normalized vector in the common space. project_common_position_to_clipspace Converts the coordinates of a point from the common space to the clip space, which can be assigned to  gl_Position  as the \"return value\" from the vertex shader. project_get_orientation_matrix Returns a matrix that rotates any vector defined in the default common space to a new orientation, such that  vec3(0, 0, 1)  is aligned with  up .  up  is a normal in common space. Remarks For consistent results, the screen space pixels are logical pixels, not device pixels, i.e. functions in the project module multiply  pixels  with  project_uDevicePixelRatio . The pixels offsets will be divided by the  w  coordinate of  gl_Position . This is simply the GPUs standard treatment of any coordinate. This means that there will be more pixels closer to the camera and less pixels further away from the camer. Setting the  focalDistance  uniform controls this. To avoid pixel sizes scaling with distance from camera, simply set  focalDistance  to 1 and multiply clipspace offset with  gl_Position.w","headings":[{"value":"project (Shader Module)","depth":1},{"value":"Usage","depth":2},{"value":"getUniforms","depth":2},{"value":"GLSL Uniforms","depth":2},{"value":"GLSL Functions","depth":2},{"value":"project_position","depth":3},{"value":"project_size","depth":3},{"value":"project_size_to_pixel","depth":3},{"value":"project_pixel_size","depth":3},{"value":"project_pixel_size_to_clipspace","depth":3},{"value":"project_normal","depth":3},{"value":"project_common_position_to_clipspace","depth":3},{"value":"project_get_orientation_matrix","depth":3},{"value":"Remarks","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/api-reference/core/project","title":"project (Shader Module)"},{"excerpt":"TransitionInterpolator Class Base interpolator class that provides common functionality required to interpolate between two  View States .

The  View  class and its subclasses are used to specify where and how your deck.gl layers should be rendered. Applications typically instantiate at least one  View  subclass. Views allow you to specify: A unique  id . The position and extent of the view on the canvas:  x ,  y ,  width , and  height . Certain camera parameters specifying how your data should be projected into this view, e.g. field of view, near/far planes, perspective vs. orthographic, etc. The  controller  to be used for this view. A controller listens to pointer events and touch gestures, and translates user input into changes in the view state. If enabled, the camera becomes interactive. deck.gl offers a set of  View  classes that package the camera and controller logic that you need to visualize and interact with your data. You may choose one or multiple  View  classes based on the type of data (e.g. geospatial, 2D chart) and the desired perspective (top down, first-person, etc). Constructor(props : Object) Parameters: id  (String, optional) A unique id of the view. In a multi-view use case, this is important for matching view states and place contents into this view. x  (String|Number, optional) A relative (e.g.  '50%' ) or absolute position. Default  0 . y  (String|Number, optional) A relative (e.g.  '50%' ) or absolute position. Default  0 . width  (String|Number, optional) A relative (e.g.  '50%' ) or absolute extent. Default  '100%' . height  (String|Number, optional) A relative (e.g.  '50%' ) or absolute extent. Default  '100%' . controller  (Function|Boolean|Object, optional) Options for viewport interactivity. null  or  false : this view is not interactive. true : initiates the default controller with default options. Controller  class (not instance): initiates the provided controller with default options. Object : controller options. This will be merged with the default controller options. controller.type : the controller class For other options, consult the documentation of  Controller . Default  null . viewState  (String|Object, optional) The optional  viewState  property enables a  View  to specify, select or select-and-modify its view state. viewState  is an overloaded property that can take either just a view state id string, or an object specifying view state parameters and optionally a view state id string: null  (default): Will select a view state based on  view.id , falling back to using the first view state. String : Will attempt to match the indicated \tview state. Object  (with  id  field): if the object contains an  id  field which matches a dynamic view state, the remaining fields in  View.viewState  will extend (be merged into a copy of) the selected dynamic view state. Object  (with no  id  field): If no  id  is provided, the  View.viewState  object will be used directly as the view state, essentially representing a fixed or constant view state. Note that specifying  viewState  as an object with an  id  field effectively allows the View to modify a dynamic view state by overriding some of its fields. This is useful in multiview situations where it enables having one view that fixes some parameters (eg. zoom, pitch and bearing to show an overview map). The  viewState  property is intended to support a number of use cases: Sharing view states between multiple views - If a  View  id is different from the designed view state's id. specify a complete, constant (fixed) view state directly in the view Overriding a partial set of view state properties from a selected view state. clear  (Boolean|Object, optional) Clears the contents (pixels) of the viewport. The value of the  clear  prop is passed as an argument to luma.gl's  clear  function. If  true  clears color and depth buffers. If an object, behaviour is controlled by the following fields: color  (Boolean or Array) - if not  false , clears all active color buffers with either the provided color or the currently set clear color. depth  (Boolean)  - if  true , clears the depth buffer. stencil  (Boolean) - if  true  clears the stencil buffer. Note that deck.gl always clears the screen before each render, and clearing, while cheap, is not totally free. This means that viewports should only specify the  clear  property if they need additional clearing, e.g. because they are rendering on top of another viewport, or want to have a different background color etc. Default  false . projectionMatrix  ( Array[16] , optional) Projection matrix. If  projectionMatrix  is not supplied, the  View  class will build a projection matrix from the following parameters: fovy  ( Number , optional) Field of view covered by camera, in the perspective case. In degrees. Default  75 . aspect  ( Number , optional) Aspect ratio. Defaults to the Viewport's  width/height  ratio. near  ( Number , optional) Distance of near clipping plane. Default  0.1 . far  ( Number , optional) Distance of far clipping plane. Default  1000 . orthographic  ( Boolean ) Whether to create an orthographic or perspective projection matrix. Default is  false  (perspective projection). focalDistance  ( Number , optional) Modifier of viewport scale. Corresponds to the number of pixels per meter. Default  1 . Methods Note: most applications just create Views with the appropriate props and do not need to call the following View methods directly. equals Returns  true  if deck.gl can determine that the supplied  View  instance is identical (equivalent) with this view. view.equals(otherView) otherView  ( View ) - Another view instance to compare with. Returns: true  - the given view is identical to the current one. Note: For speed, deck.gl uses shallow equality. This means that a value of  false  does not guarantee that the views are not equivalent. makeViewport Parameters: width  ( Number ) - Dimension in pixels of the target viewport. height  ( Number ) - Dimension in pixels of the target viewport. viewState  ( Object ) -  view state  compatible with the current  View  subclass in use. Note that any prop provided to the  View  constructor will override that inside the  viewState . Returns a  Viewport  using the viewport type, props in the  View  and provided dimensions and view state. getDimensions Returns the actual pixel position and size that this  View  will occupy in a given \"canvas\" size. Parameters: width  ( Number ) - Dimension in CSS pixels of the deck.gl \"canvas\". height  ( Number ) - Dimension in CSS pixels of the deck.gl \"canvas\". Returns an object containing the following fields: x  ( Number ) - x position in CSS pixels y  ( Number ) - y position in CSS pixels width  ( Number ) - width in CSS pixels height  ( Number ) - height in CSS pixels Remarks The  View  class and its subclasses are perhaps best thought of as geospatially enabled counterparts of the typical  Camera  classes found in most 3D libraries.

A deck.gl  Viewport  is essentially a geospatially enabled camera, and combines a number of responsibilities, which can project and unproject 3D coordinates to the screen. Viewport  classes are focused on mathematical operations such as coordinate projection/unprojection, and calculation of  view  and  projection  matrices and other uniforms needed by the WebGL vertex shaders. The basic  Viewport  class is a generic geospatially enabled version of the typical 3D \"camera\" class you would find in most 3D/WebGL/OpenGL library. While the  Viewport  class can certainly be used directly if you need and are able to calculate your own projection matrices, you typically do not directly create  Viewport  instances. Instead,  Viewport  classes are created using the  View  class descriptors and the current  viewState . Overview of Viewport Classes Viewport Class Description Viewport The base viewport has to be supplied view and projection matrices. It is typically only instantiated directly if the application needs to work with viewports that have been supplied from external sources, such as the  WebVR  API. WebMercatorViewport While all  Viewport  subclasses are geospatially enabled, this class renders from a perspective that matches a typical top-down map and is designed to synchronize perfectly with a mapbox-gl base map (even in 3D enabled perspective mode). Usage The  Viewport  class is normally not instantiated directly. The  View  class is more commonly used by applications. deck.gl automatically creates  Viewport s from  View s and  viewState  when needed, using the  View.makeViewport  method.

Projection Matrix Parameters. projectionMatrix  ( Array[16] , optional) - 4x4 projection matrix. If  projectionMatrix  is not supplied, an attempt is made to build from the remaining parameters. Otherwise the remaining parameters will be ignored. fovy  ( Number , optional) - Field of view covered by camera, in the perspective case. In degrees. Default  75 . aspect  ( Number , optional) - Aspect ratio. Defaults to the Viewport's  width/height  ratio. near  ( Number , optional) - Distance of near clipping plane. Default  0.1 . (Note that in geospatial viewports, this actual distance used is scaled by the height of the screen). far  ( Number , optional) - Distance of far clipping plane. Default  1000 . (Note that in geospatial viewports, this actual distance used is scaled by the height of the screen). orthographic  ( Boolean , optional) - whether to create an orthographic or perspective projection matrix. Default  false  (perspective projection). orthographicFocalDistance  ( Number , optional) - Used by orthographic projections only.

Each plane is defined by its normal  normal  and distance from\nthe origin  distance  (such that point  x  is on the plane if  dot(normal, x) === distance ) in the  common space . Returns: {near: {normal, distance}, far: {normal, distance}, left: {normal, distance}, right: {normal, distance}, top: {normal, distance}, bottom: {normal, distance}} Remarks The  Viewport  class and its subclasses are perhaps best thought of as geospatially enabled counterparts of the typical  Camera  classes found in most 3D libraries. The  Viewport  class works together with the  project  shader module and generates the uniforms that module needs to project correctly in GLSL code. Accordingly, a main function of viewports is to generate WebGL compatible view and projection matrices (column-major format). Functions (including projection and unprojection of coordinates) are available both in JavaScript and in GLSL, so that layers can do consistent projection calculations in both GLSL and JavaScript. To support pixel project/unproject functions (in addition to the clipspace projection that Camera classes typically manage), the  Viewport  is also aware of the viewport extents. In geospatial setups, Viewports can contain geospatial anchors.

Returns:  New  WebMercatorViewport  fit around the given bounding box. Remarks Because  WebMercatorViewport  a subclass of  Viewport , an application can implement support for generic 3D  Viewport s and automatically get the ability to accept web mercator style map coordinates. A limitation at the moment is that there is no way to extract web mercator parameters from a \"generic\" viewport, so for map synchronization applications (rendering on top of a typical map component that only accepts web mercator parameters) the  WebMercatorViewport  is necessary. Facilitates the necessary mercator projections by breaking them into a minimal non-linear piece followed by a standard projection chain. Making deck.gl work with non-mapbox map systems  in perspective mode  might require subclassing  WebMercatorViewport  and adjust the projection so it matches the map's projection.

When Alpha not provided a value of 255 is used. colorDomain  is divided into  colorRange.length  equal segments, each mapped to one color in  colorRange . intensity  (Number, optional)  Default:  1 Value that is multiplied with the total weight at a pixel to obtain the final weight. A value larger than  1  biases the output color towards the higher end of the spectrum, and a value less than  1  biases the output color towards the lower end of the spectrum. threshold  (Number, optional)  Default:  0.05 The  HeatmapLayer  reduces the opacity of the pixels with relatively low weight to create a fading effect at the edge. A larger  threshold  smoothens the boundaries of color blobs, while making pixels with low relative weight harder to spot (due to low alpha value). threshold  is defined as the ratio of the fading weight to the max weight, between  0  and  1 . For example,  0.1  affects all pixels with weight under 10% of the max. threshold  is ignored when  colorDomain  is specified. colorDomain  (Array, optional)  Default:  null Weight of each data object is distributed to to all the pixels in a circle centered at the object position, weight a pixel receives is inversely proportional to its distance from the center. Pixels that fall into multiple circles will have sum of all weights. And the weight of the pixel determines its color. When  colorDomain  is specified, all pixels with weight with in specified  colorDomain  will get mapped to  colorRange , pixels with weight less than  colorDomain[0]  will fade out (reduced alpha) and pixels with weight more than  colorDomain[1]  will mapped to the highest color in  colorRange . When not specified, maximum weight ( maxWeight ) is auto calculated and domain will be set to  maxWeight * threshold ,  maxWeight . aggregation  (String, optional) Default:  'SUM' Operation used to aggregate all data point weights to calculate a pixel's color value. One of  'SUM'  or  'MEAN' .  'SUM'  is used when an invalid value is provided. Data Accessors getPosition  ( Function , optional) Default:  object => object.position Method called to retrieve the position of each point. getWeight  ( Function , optional) Default:  1 Method called to retrieve weight of each point. By default each point will use a weight of  1 . Limitations The  HeatmapLayer  performs aggregation on the GPU. This feature is fully supported in evergreen desktop browsers, but limited in the following platforms due to partial WebGL support: iOS Safari: WebGL context does not support rendering to a float texture. The layer therefore falls back to an 8-bit low-precision mode, where weights must be integers and the accumulated weights in any pixel cannot exceed 255.

Also check our  vis.gl blog  for news about new releases and features in deck.gl. deck.gl v8.3 Release Date: Oct 12, 2020 New module: @deck.gl/carto Integration with the powerful geospatial analytics platform  CARTO . This new modules makes it easy to visualize regular Tables and vector tilesets in CARTO. It offers two new layers: CartoSQLLayer : a layer to visualize data hosted in your CARTO account and to apply custom SQL. CartoBQTilerLayer : a layer to visualize large datasets (millions or billions of rows) directly from  Google BigQuery . This effort enables applications to leverage CARTO's smart back-end capabilities, dynamic queries and much more. Visit the module's  documentation  to get started. TileLayer getTileData  now receives an additional argument  signal  that implements  AbortSignal . Tile requests may now be aborted if there are too many queued or ongoing requests. The  getTileData  function passed in to the current layer instance will be called rather than the first layer instance. This allows applications to progressively adjust loading behavior without having to reload all tiles. New  onTileUnload  callback URL templates now support  {-y}  for TMS indexing Experimental support for  GlobeView  in  TileLayer  and  MVTLayer Improved memory usage in tile caching General Performance Layers with  pickable  disabled (the default) skip generating picking attributes. This can improve initial loading time and memory usage if a large layer does not have to be interactive. If no layer is pickable, deck no longer creates the picking FrameBuffer to save memory. Deck  also added some experimental  optimization options  to allow more fine-grained control of memory usage on memory-restricted devices. pydeck 0.5 pydeck 0.5 includes new event handlers —  on_hover ,  on_click ,  on_view_state_change , and  on_resize  — which can be used to create rich interactive applications in Jupyter. This release works in sync with deck.gl 8.3. Other Improvements SimpleMeshLayer  adds  _useMeshColors  prop to use vertex colors from  mesh  instead of  getColor DataFilterExtension  adds a  countItems  option. It enables the GPU to report the number of objects that pass the filter criteria via the  onFilteredItemsChange  callback. PathStyleExtension  adds a  highPrecisionDash  option. It creates nicer dashes when used with small path segments, at the price of some CPU overhead. IconLayer  fixed an issue of visual artifacts rendering anti-aliased borders deck.gl v8.2 Release Date: June 28, 2020 Tiled Layers Many new features are added to  TileLayer ,  MVTLayer  and  TerrainLayer  to improve correctness, performance and ease of use. MVTLayer  projects more accurately at high zoom levels. autoHighlight  in the  MVTLayer  now works on features that are split across multiple tiles, identified by the new  uniqueIdProperty  prop. All geospatially tiled layers now handle high pitch angles better. Far away tiles from the camera are loaded at lower zoom levels, avoiding loading too many tiles. Tiled layers now use a request scheduler to prioritize loading the most recently visible tiles during viewport navigation. See the new  maxRequests  prop. TileLayer  may continue to display tiles when underzoomed. See the new  extent  prop. Fine-tune the tiles displayed by the  TileLayer  with the new  zRange  prop when dealing with 3D content. This is used by the  TerrainLayer  when viewing high-altitude regions. TileLayer 's  tileSize  prop can be used to fine-tune the zoom level at which tiles are loaded. TileLayer 's  renderSubLayers  is now always called after the tile layer is loaded, i.e.  props.data  is never a Promise. TileLayer  can now be used in multi-view applications, as long as each  TileLayer  instance is rendered into one view. See  documentation  for an example. GlobeView For geospatial data, a new projection mode -- globe projection is now available alongside Web Mercator projection. In this release, the feature is exposed via the experimental  GlobeView  class. Currently there is no base map provider under this view. You may use the  BitmapLayer  or  GeoJsonLayer  to render a backdrop for your data. Before getting started with  this example , make sure you check out the  docs  for the limitations of the current implementation. Antimeridian Handling GreatCircleLayer  now renders correctly across the 180th meridian. The  PathLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  GeoJsonLayer  now support the  wrapLongitude  prop.When enabled, the connection between any two neighboring vertices is drawn on the shorter side of the world, and split into two if it crosses the 180th meridian. Note that this introduces CPU overhead at runtime. Pydeck Pydeck 0.4.0 introduces support for JupyterLab 2.0, support for a Google Maps base map, a new UI element for providing text descriptions of a map, and many of the new features of deck.gl 8.2, like the ability to render data to either a globe or a Mercator projection. See the new  website  for documentation and examples. Miscellaneous Multiple layers that share the same  data  URL now only download the data once. ScatterplotLayer  added  radiusUnits  prop New  FillStyleExtension  fills polygons with repeated pattern from a sprite image. ArcLayer  added  greatCircle  prop.  GreatCircleLayer  is now a special case of the  ArcLayer  and support rendering an elevated curve by supplying  getHeight . @deck.gl/test-utils  added new  testLayerAsync  API. When using auto-highlight,  highlightColor  now accepts a callback that returns a color based on which object is picked. deck.gl v8.1 Release Date: Mar 17, 2020 Growing Tile Solutions The  @deck.gl/geo-layers  module added many new features to address popular tiled data use cases. TileLayer Multiple bugs have been fixed in the  TileLayer  regarding data fetching and tree traversal. The layer now supports non-geospatial views. Check out this  example  by  @ilan-gold  that renders a 576 Megapixel image of the moon. New props are added to better control the layer's behavior: maxCacheByteSize : for precise management of memory usage refinementStrategy : to reduce flashing/overlapping during loading tileSize  (non-geospatial only) MVTTileLayer Based on the  TileLayer ,  MVTTileLayer  loads and renders tiles in the  Mapbox Vector Tiles specification . This new layer make it easier to leverage the many great  open source tools  in use with deck.gl. This effort is led by contributors from  CARTO . TerrainLayer TerrainLayer  loads color-encoded heightmap and reconstructs 3D mesh surfaces. Check out our  example . ESRI + deck.gl In collaboration with GIS industry leader  ESRI , we are releasing new experimental features that work with ArcGIS basemap and I3S tiles. @deck.gl/arcgis You can now use ArcGIS basemaps with deck.gl. This new module lets apps render deck.gl layers into the WebGL context of  ArcGIS API for JavaScript . 3D scene view support is experimental in this initial release. To get started, check out  the example  and  the documentation . Tile3DLayer and I3S format Tile3DLayer  is adding preliminary support for the  OGC Indexed 3d Scene (I3S)  format. See  documentation  for details. World Repeating in Web Mercator Maps The  MapView  now supports repeating worlds at low zoom levels. For backward compatibility, this feature is opt-in. Apps may turn it on by setting  views: new MapView({repeat: true})  on  Deck  or  DeckGL . Repeating is always on when using  MapboxLayer  and  GoogleMapsOverlay . As a result,  GoogleMapsOverlay  now supports all Google Maps zoom levels. pydeck 0.3.0 pydeck now uses the  binary attribute API  to communicate between Python and JavaScript. This greatly increases the speed and the amount of data that it can render. pydeck now supports external layer modules via a new  custom_libraries  setting. Other Improvements When using  Deck  as a stateful component, you can now update its  initialViewState  prop to reset the camera. A new prop  onError  is added to  Deck  to handle errors, instead of crashing the app. Layer  instances now expose a new member  isLoaded . PathLayer 's joint calculation is improved when using with short line segments and extreme angles. BrushingExtension  supports a new  brushingTarget  mode  source_target . PathStyleExtension  now has a new mode  offset . This feature can be used for positioning polygon strokes inside/outside, or rendering overlapped paths in opposite directions. TextLayer  now supports  binary attributes . deck.gl v8.0 Release Date: Dec 20, 2019 Performance Performance is one of the biggest focus of this update. Layer updates (data change) is 1.5x the speed of the last release, and redraw (viewport change) is 2.5x. Benchmark of using 1000 ScatterplotLayers on 2016 Macbook Pro, 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB memory, AMD Radeon R9 M370X 2 GB v7.3 v8.0 Change Initialize 298ms 235ms -21% Update 112ms 72ms -36% Redraw (CPU Time) 76ms 26ms -66% Redraw (GPU Time) 17ms 10ms -41% In addition to runtime performance, deck.gl also added a production mode to optimize bundle size. The v8.0 minified bundle of  @deck.gl/core  is 50kb lighter than that of v7.3. Better Binary Data Support It is now possible to replace a layer's accessors with binary data attributes. This technique offers the maximum performance in terms of data throughput in applications where a lot of data is loaded and/or frequently updated: This use case is discussed in detail in the  performance developer guide . GPU Data Filter in Aggregation Layers DataFilterExtension  now supports the following layers from  @deck.gl/aggregation-layers : HeatMapLayer GPUGridLayer ScreenGridlayer  (GPU aggregation only) ContourLayer  (GPU aggregation only) GridLayer  (GPU aggregation only) pydeck pydeck now supports JupyterLab. The Jupyter widget now allows users to click multiple objects in a visualization and pass them to the Python backend. JavaScript errors are now surfaced in the Jupyter UI. Support for non-Mercator visualizations. The JSON parser has introduced syntactic identifiers in an effort to become more generic and robust. It is able to work with a wider range of data formats and layer types. See upgrade guide for details. Other New Features and Improvements Render to a frame buffer by specifying the  _framebuffer  prop of  Deck . Pick a 3d surface point in the scene by passing  unproject3D: true  to  deck.pickObject  or  deck.pickMultipleObjects . ArcLayer  supports drawing arcs between two 3D positions. TextLayer  adds a new prop  backgroundColor . Picking works when the cursor is over an empty pixel in the text. TextLayer  adds  maxWidth  and  wordBreak  props to support text wrapping. ScenegraphLayer  adds props  sizeMinPixels  and  sizeMaxPixels . 64-bit positions are now 3D instead of 2D. This improves render precision when using  OrbitView . FirstPersonView  now supports pitch; controller works more intuitively; graduates from experimental status. FlyToInterpolator  now supports  duration: 'auto' . deck.gl v7.3 Release Date: Sep 26, 2019 Tile3DLayer deck.gl has partnered with  Cesium  to implement support for the OGC  3D Tiles specification . This makes it possible to to render city-scale (billions of points/features) and country-scale (trillions of features) datasets in the browser. In this initial release, the layer has full support for point clouds and experimental support for glTF tiles. Try the  demo  for yourself. pydeck: deck.gl for Python and Jupyter Notebooks We have released a python module  pydeck  for Python developers to interact with deck.gl via a native Python API: pydeck  is also integrated with Jupyter Notebook, enabling you to interactively create deck.gl visualizations right in your notebooks. See  documentation  for details. Transition System Improvements Generic prop transition: the layer  transitions  prop now supports many more props than just accessors! Any prop of type  number  or  array  can now also use the built-in transition system. New transition type: spring-based transition support is added to the transition settings. See  documentation  for details. @deck.gl/json The  JSONConverter  class has been generalized and can now be used independently of deck.gl to \"hydrate\" JavaScript from JSON text specifications. This supports its use a foundation technology for providing non-JavaScript bindings such as  pydeck . This has caused some breaking changes to this experimental module. For details and work-arounds see the upgrade guide. Under the Hood We have introduced a new resource management system to luma.gl and deck.gl core. This significantly reduces the initial loading time if an app uses multiple layers of the same type. It is now easier to supply external buffers to layer attributes as deck.gl no longer requires them to match the default buffer type. For custom layer authors: the attribute system is simplified. One may now use  type: GL.DOUBLE  when adding an attribute to the  AttributeManager . the attribute will automatically be mapped to two 32-bit shader attributes  <attrbName>  and  <attrbName>64xyLow . Auto Tooltip A new prop  getTooltip  is added to the  Deck  class. By supplying this callback, an app may specify the content and styling of a built-in tooltip. Other Features/Improvements OrbitController  now supports 360 degree rotation on both axis. Relax  minRotationX  and  maxRotationX  to use this feature. Customizable device pixel ratio :  Deck 's  useDevicePixels  prop now accepts a number as well as boolean values. SimpleMeshLayer  and  ScenegraphLayer  now respect the  opacity  prop. IconLayer  has added a new prop  alphaCutoff  for customizing picking behavior. HeatmapLayer  is out of  Experimental  phase and can now be rendered using  WebGL1  context. A new prop  colorDomain  added for custom domain specification. deck.gl v7.2 Release Date: Aug 10, 2019 Layer Extensions A new module  @deck.gl/extensions  has joined the deck.gl family.\nLayer extensions are bonus features that you can optionally add to the core deck.gl layers. As a start, this module offers the following extensions: BrushingExtension : GPU-based data brushing, see \"examples\" section of this website DataFilterExtension : GPU-based data filtering, see \"examples\" section of this website Fp64Extension : See  upgrade guide  if you are using the deprecated  fp64  mode. For instructions on authoring your own layer extensions, visit  developer guide . HeatmapLayer The   @deck.gl/aggregation-layers  module now offers  HeatmapLayer  as an experimental layer. It performs density distribution on the GPU to provide fast dynamic heatmaps. The layer currently only supports WebGL2-enabled browsers. A fallback solution for WebGL1 will be added later. Shadows in LightingEffect As an experimental feature, the  LightingEffect  can now render shadows from up to two directional light sources. To enable shadows, set  _shadow: true  when constructing a\n DirectionalLight  or  SunLight . New Ways to Supply and Update Layer Data Streaming Data Support Layers now have built-in streaming support. The  data  prop now accepts an  async iterable  object. As new batches of data are resolved, the layer is updated incrementally. This eliminates the need to manually merge chunks of data or manage multiple layer instances.\nSee details in the  data prop  documentation and the updated  performance optimization  examples. Partial Data Update By default, when the  data  prop value of a layer changes shallowly, all of its attributes are recalculated and re-uploaded to the GPU. You may now compare the old and new data arrays and only update the range of elements that have actually changed. This can lead to significant performance improvement if a few rows in a large data table need to change frequently. See the  _dataDiff prop  documentation. Using External Buffers It is now easier to build attributes as typed arrays outside of a layer, e.g. in a web worker or on the server. See the \"Supplying attributes directly\" section in  performance optimization . Other Layer Features and Optimizations BitmapLayer 's  image  prop now accepts a  HTMLVideoElement . TextLayer  now supports line breaks in the text string. A new prop  lineHeight  is added. Layer matching performance is improved. This affects applications with a large number of layers. HeatmapLayer  now supports WebGL1. deck.gl v7.1 Release Date: 2019 Post-processing Effects A new  PostProcessEffect  class, working with   @luma.gl/effects  module,  offers screen-space post-processing effects such as blur, noise, halftone, ink, etc. Layer Enhancements GridLayer GridLayer  is enhanced to support GPU Aggregation. By default GPU Aggregation is disabled, and can be enabled using  gpuAggregation  prop. For more details check  GridLayer . Two new layers  GPUGridLayer  and  CPUGridLayer  are also offered, which perform aggregation on CPU and GPU respectively. The following table compares the performance between CPU and GPU aggregations using random data points: #points CPU #iternations/sec GPU #iterations/sec Notes 25K 535 359 GPU is  33%  slower 100K 119 437 GPU is  267%  faster 1M 12.7 158 GPU is  1144%  faster Numbers are collected on a 2018 15-inch Macbook Pro (CPU: 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 and GPU: Radeon Pro 560X 4 GB) ColumnLayer & H3HexagonLayer Now support drawing outline. In 3D mode (extruded), set  wireframe: true . In 2D mode, enable stroke by setting  stroked: true  with  getLineWidth ,  getLineColor  among other stroke options. Improved the performance of  H3HexagonLayer . PathLayer Added  billboard  prop for screen space extrusion when rendering 3D paths Improved precision of joint calculation TripsLayer Now support 3D paths by adding a  getTimestamps  accessor. See layer documentation for details. ScenegraphLayer Added  getScene  and  getAnimator  to allow more flexibility when loading models. Experimental  _lighting  property for PBR lighting. Experimental  _imageBasedLightingEnvironment  property for image-based lighting. 64-bit Precision in Info-vis OrthographicView  and  OrbitView  now also support 64-bit projection, with no extra code changes required. This greatly improves the visual quality when rendering very large and/or dense graphs. Use react-map-gl Components with DeckGL For React users, it is now easy to use  react-map-gl  components with DeckGL, including DOM-based  marker ,  popup ,  navigation control  and  fullscreen control . This can be done by supplying the  ContextProvider  prop on  DeckGL : Performance Metrics Added a  metrics  property to  Deck  instances that tracks performance statistics like fps, CPU/GPU render time and memory usage. See  Deck  class documentation for details. deck.gl v7.0 Release Date: April 19, 2019 New Layer Catalog As the number of deck.gl layers grow, we are splitting existing and new layers into multiple submodules for better dependency management. These new layer modules are:  @deck.gl/layers  - Primitive layers that are the building blocks of all visualizations ArcLayer BitmapLayer   New ColumnLayer   New GeoJsonLayer GridCellLayer IconLayer LineLayer PathLayer PointCloudLayer PolygonLayer ScatterplotLayer SolidPolygonLayer TextLayer  @deck.gl/aggregation-layers  - Advanced layers that aggregate data into alternative representations, e.g. heatmap, contour, hex bins, etc. ContourLayer GPUGridLayer GridLayer HexagonLayer ScreenGridLayer  @deck.gl/geo-layers  - Additional layers that handle geospatial use cases and GIS formats. GreatCircleLayer   New H3ClusterLayer   New H3HexagonLayer   New S2Layer   New TileLayer   New TripsLayer   New  @deck.gl/mesh-layers  - Additional layers that render 3D meshes and  scene graphs . SimpleMeshLayer   New ScenegraphLayer   New glTF Support and Loaders.gl The new  ScenegraphLayer  and  SimpleMeshLayer  support loading 3D models and scenegraphs in the popular  glTF™  asset format.  glTF is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D assets, with a rich ecosystem of tools and extensions.  All variants of glTF 2.0 are supported, including binary  .glb  files as well as JSON  .gltf  files with binary assets in base64 encoding or in separate files. We are releasing  loaders.gl  as a major new companion framework to deck.gl and luma.gl. Loaders.gl provides a suite of 3D file format loaders.  See  What's New in luma.gl v7.0  for more details. New Effects System A new effects system is written from the ground up for v7.0. This opens the possibilities for many exciting visual effect features down the road. As a start, we're introducing  LightingEffect  - an easier, more comprehensive way to control the lighting for your layers. See  Using Lighting  for details. Layer API Binary data support : In v7.0 we are making binary data a first-class citizen of deck.gl. Whereas the  data  prop of layers only accepted JavaScript arrays in the past, you may now provide a non-iterable object to  data . See  example . Size units : In the past, some deck.gl layers use pixel sizes (e.g.  IconLayer ,  TextLayer ,  LineLayer  and  ArcLayer ) and some layers use meter sizes (e.g.  ScatterplotLayer ,  PathLayer ). In v7.0 we are introducing new props  sizeUnits  and  widthUnits  that allow users to tweak these behaviors.  *MinPixels  and  *MaxPixels  props are also added for layers that previously only support pixel sizes. Billboard : Prior this v7.0,  IconLayer  and  TextLayer  are rendered as billboards (i.e. always facing the camera). A prop  billboard  is added to these layers so that you can place icons and texts relative to the world. Google Maps Integration Starting v7.0, deck.gl has experimental support for Google Maps with the  @deck.gl/google-maps  module. It allows you to construct a Deck instance as a custom Google Maps  OverlayView . See module documentation page for a full list of supported features. Improved Test Utilities The   @deck.gl/test-utils  module is revamped with two new exports: generateLayerTests  - automatically create test cases for use with  testLayer  to test layer conformance. SnapshotTestRunner  - automated integration test for WebGL. Renders deck.gl layers, takes screenshot and compare with golden images in headless Chromium. Read more in  Developer Guide: Testing . deck.gl v6.4 Release Date: Jan 29, 2019 Layer API Improvements ScatterplotLayer  now supports drawing both stroke and fill, and outline width can be controlled per-instance. ContourLayer  now supports isoband - filling between two thresholds. ScreenGridLayer  now supports aggregating by min/max/mean. TextLayer  adds new props that allow better control of the font rendering quality, including font weight and raster size. The layer can also optionally generate a font atlas with  Signed Distance Fields , which yields a much crisper look when rendering large font sizes. IconLayer  supports dynamically packed icon atlas. Users can now load programmatically generated image urls as icons, for example Facebook profile images. PathLayer 's  getPath  and  PolygonLayer 's  getPolygon  props now support flattened coordinates instead of nested arrays, making it easier for these layers to use binary data. See each layer's documentation for full API changes. Composite Layer Customization (experimental) It is now possible to fine-tune sublayer appearances by passing a new experimental prop  _subLayerProps  to a composite layer. For example, in a  GeoJsonLayer , one may wish to make only the point features interactive, or replace the circles with icons. This offers a light alternative to overriding composite layer behaviors without creating a custom class. See  CompositeLayer  for details. deck.gl v6.3 Release Date: Nov 19, 2018 Prop Types System Layers can now supply rich definitions to their default props. This enables prop validation in debug mode and aggressively blocks unnecessary layer update to boost rendering performance. Complex composite layers such as the GeoJsonLayer can be up to 2x faster in certain React applications. See  upgrade guide  if you are an author of custom layers. New Interaction Callbacks onDragStart ,  onDrag  and  onDragEnd  callback props are added to  Deck  and base  Layer  class. GPUAggregator Improvements The experimental  GPUAggregator  class now supports Min/Max/Mean in addition to Sum. Also added the ability to specify multiple weights with custom aggregation operation. deck.gl v6.2 Release Date: Oct 15, 2018 Mapbox Custom Layer API A new experimental module   @deck.gl/mapbox  makes deck.gl work with the custom layers API in the latest Mapbox release. Using this feature, mapbox and deck.gl layers can be freely \"interleaved\", enabling a number of layer mixing effects, such as drawing behind map labels, z-occlusion between deck.gl 3D objects and Mapbox buildings, etc. For usage and limitations, see  module documentation . 32-bit High-Precision Projection First introduced in v6.1 as  COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT_EXPERIMENTAL , the new projection system offers high-precision results similar to that of the old  fp64  mode without the compatibility issues or performance hit of running the much heavier 64-bit shader. Starting v6.2, this coordinate system becomes the default for all layers. See  upgrade guide  if you still need the old  fp64  mode. CPU/GPU Parity in Projection The  layer.project()  method now supports all coordinate systems including METER_OFFSETS, LNGLAT_OFFSETS and IDENTITY. deck.gl v6.1 Release date: Sep 7, 2018 High-Precision Geospatial Projection (Experimental) The projection algorithm used for geospatial coordinates (layers with  coordinateSystem: COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT ) has supplemented with a \"hybrid\" projection/offset based implementation ( COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT_EXPERIMENTAL ) that rivals 64-bit precision at 32-bit speeds. This mode is expected to make the use of  fp64  precision unnecessary for most applications, which in turn should increase application performance and avoid issues on untested graphics drivers. Dynamic Meridian LNGLAT  projection modes can automatically wrap coordinates over the 180th meridian for the best placement in the current viewport. Set the  wrapLongitude  prop in a layer to  true  to enable this behavior. This mode will be helpful when visualizing data close to the ante-meridian (e.g. New Zealand, Australia etc). JSON API (Experimental) A new experimental module  @deck.gl/json  provides a set of classes that allows deck.gl layers and views to be specified using JSON-formatted text files. To facilitate experimentation, a JSON layer browser is available on  http://deck.gl/playground . Enhanced Multiview Support deck.gl's multiview support has been significantly enhanced. New  View  properties give applications more control over rendering, making it possible to implement e.g. overlapping views, partially synchronized views (share some but not all view state props), views with different background colors etc. ContourLayer deck.gl's layer catalog is extended by adding new  ContourLayer , this layer can be used to render contours, also called iso-lines for given set of threshold values.  ContourLayer  supports both WebMercator projection (geospatial applications) and Orthographic projection (infovis applications). IconLayer When the  mask  of the icon is  false , the opacity of the icon can be controlled by  getColor  while still keeping the pixel color from image. When  mask  is  true , user defined color is applied. GPU Aggregation Enhancements (Experimental) Several under the hood changes in GPU Aggregation flow to support multiple layer coordinate systems (LNGLAT and IDENTITY). deck.gl v6.0 Release date: July 18, 2018 Attribute Transitions (WebGL2-compatible browsers only) Attribute transitions enable applications to simultaneously animate changes in positions, colors and other attributes of all objects in a layer. GPU acceleration to  All core deck.gl layers now support attribute transitions, including  HexagonLayer ,  GridLayer  and  GeoJsonLayer . GPU Accelerations allow millions of objects to be animated. Transition settings also support  enter  callback to customize instance entrance behavior. See documentation of the  transitions prop . View State Transitions View State Transitions (aka Viewport Transitions) are now officially supported. Transitions are provided through the  DeckGL.viewState  prop. For more details check  ViewState Transitions  documentation. ScreenGridLayer: GPU accelerated aggregation ScreenGridLayer is updated to support aggregation on GPU. GPU aggregation can be 10x faster and is capable of aggregating large data sets (millions of points). Two new props  gpuAggregation  for selecting CPU or GPU aggregation and  cellMarginPixels  to control cell margin size have been added. Finally, picking information now contains aggregated details. Controllers: Simplified Usage deck.gl can now infer appropriate  Controller  types from the types of your  View . For example, when using the default geospatial view ( MapView ), a  MapController  can now be requested simply by setting the view's  controller  props to  true . You may also pass an object with additional controller options to this prop, for example  controller={{doubleClickZoom: false}} . See documentation of  View . Pixel Sizes aligned with HTML/CSS deck.gl pixel sizes (e.g. in  LineLayer ,  IconLayer  and  TextLayer ) now match their HTML/SVG counterparts. WebGL parameters can now be set declaratively It is now possible to set global WebGL parameters (controlling how the GPU renders) by supplying a  Deck.parameters  property object. This gives applications a simple declarative way to control things like blend modes and depth testing, without having to define an  onWebGLInitialized()  callback. Note that  parameters  can still be supplied to individual layers, overriding any global parameters for that layer only. React API Enhancements The  DeckGL  React component now provides a more powerful API to create sophisticated visualizations, highlights including: DeckGL  can be used as a \"stateful\" component providing automatic interactivity You can now specify deck.gl views (in addition to layers) directly using JSX Adds \"render callbacks\" for dynamically rendering React children based on deck.gl view states, providing more control over synchronization of positions and sizes between deck.gl's WebGL view layouts and React's DOM components. See  Use with React  for more details. deck.gl v5.3 Release date: June 01, 2018 Automatic Interactivity A new  Deck.initialViewState  property allows the application to enable map or view interactivity simply by supplying an initial view state, e.g.  {longitude, latitude, zoom} . deck.gl will automatically initialize a Controller class and listen to view state changes, without the application having to implement callbacks to track the view state. Automatic Data Loading The  Layer.data  prop now accepts URLs (i.e. strings). deck.gl will automatically start loading such URLs, parse them as JSON and once loaded, use the resulting data to render the layer. This can e.g. remove the need for applications to set up callbacks to handle load completion. Deep Picking deck.gl can now pick occluded objects using the new  Deck.pickMultipleObjects  method, which returns a list of all objects under the mouse, instead of just the top-most object. Switch between Perspective and Orthographic mode The  View  classes can now build an orthographic projection matrix from the same \"field of view\" parameter it uses to create perspective mode (rather than requiring a separate set of parameters). This makes switching between perspective and orthographic projection modes easier then ever (simply set the new  View.orthographic  prop to  true  to activate orthographic projection). Per-instance stroke width in LineLayer and ArcLayer LineLayer and ArcLayer added a new accessor  getStrokeWidth  to replace the old  strokeWidth  prop. When specified with a function, you can control the width of each arc/line segment dynamically. Constant Accessors Many layer accessor props now accept constant values. For example, when constructing a ScatterplotLayer, what used to be  getColor: d => [255, 200, 0]  can now be written as  getColor: [255, 200, 0] . This is not only a convenience: constant values of accessors don't use GPU memory and can be updated very quickly and thus do not require an  updateTrigger . Consult the documentation for each layer to see which accessors are supported. @deck.gl/layers submodule Core layers are broken out from   @deck.gl/core  to a new submodule   @deck.gl/layers . Users of  deck.gl  are not affected by this change. deck.gl v5.2 Release date: April 24, 2018 Use deck.gl without React deck.gl can now be used in non-React applications. A new top-level JavaScript class  Deck  is provided as an alternative to the traditional top-level  DeckGL  React component, and the core deck.gl npm module no longer has any React dependencies. This allows deck.gl to be used in any JavaScript application or framework. The new non-React API is officially supported, however since it is not yet extensively battle-tested in applications there may be some rough corners, so to help developers set expectations we are labeling this as a \"pre release\" intended for early adopters. Scripting Support deck.gl now publishes a bundle that can be imported using a simple  <script>  statement in HTML to give access to the deck.gl API. This makes deck.gl easy to use in e.g. \"codepens\" and for casual programming and visualizations. See our  scripting blog post . Multiple Modules deck.gl is now published as multiple npm modules allowing applications to choose which features to import. The basic modules are: @deck.gl/core  - the core deck.gl API (JavaScript classes, including the  Deck  top-level class). @deck.gl/react  - React bindings for deck.gl (i.e. the top-level  DeckGL  React class). deck.gl  - The classic module is still supported for backwards compatibility with React applications. Multi-Viewport Support deck.gl allows you to divide your screen into multiple viewports and render layers from different perspectives. It is e.g. possible to render a top-down map view next to a first person view and allow your users to \"walk around\" in the city onto which your data is overlaid. The  Deck.views  property accepts instances of  View  classes, such as  MapView  and  FirstPersonView : MapController It is now possible to specify a  MapController  as a  controller  for the  Deck  or  DeckGL  classes, instead of relying on e.g.  react-map-gl  or experimental classes to drive event handling. Automatic Resize Handling It is no longer necessary for deck.gl applications to track screen size and manage the exact  width  and  height  of the  Deck  or  DeckGL  components.  width  and  height  can now be specified using CSS descriptors (e.g.  width = 100% ): Layers TextLayer (New) A  TextLayer  has been added to the core layer catalog for rendering labels with WebGL. ScreenGridLayer Color Scale Support  (Experimental) - New experimental props  colorRange  and  colorDomain  are added to ScreenGridLayer. These props provide more fine tune control over how grid cells are colored, and brings the ScreenGridLayer into parity with other aggregation layers (i.e. HexagonLayer and GridLayer). Experimental Layers A number of experimental deck.gl layers are published in a new module  @deck.gl/experimental-layers . Be aware that use of these layers come with caveats and are mainly intended for early adopters. Please refer to  roadmap  for more information. Test Utilities deck.gl now provides a suite of  test utilities  that make it easy to test both layers and applications. The utilities support visual regression testing against \"golden\" images, as well as utilities for traditional unit testing of layers. The utilities come pre-integrated with tools that help automate the running of browser based render tests from the console. To start using the utilities, install the new ( @deck.gl/test-utils ) module. Dist Size Reduction Work on bundle size reduction continues. In this release, the focus has been on leveraging the tree-shaking abilities of the Babel 7 and Webpack 4 combination. In addition, new article about  Application Bundling and Tree Shaking  has been added to the docs. Shader Modules project32 (New) Unified 32/64-bit projection  - A new common API for projection is implemented in both the  project64  shader module and a new  project32  shader module allowing the same vertex shader can be used for both 32-bit and 64-bit projection. This simplifies adding fp64 support to layers and reduces bundle size. See  docs  for more details. deck.gl v5.1 Release date: Feb 16, 2018 Layer Improvements Layer Transitions Many layers now support smooth visual transitions of e.g. positions and colors of layer elements, animating the update of the layers element to match a new data set. The animations are done on the GPU and can thus support very large number of elements. Use the new  transitions  prop on the  Layer  class to specify things like  transition duration ,  easing function  and  callbacks . Transitions are only supported on WebGL2-capable browsers such as Chrome and Firefox. The  transitions  prop will simply be ignored on WebGL1 browsers. React Improvements Use JSX to render deck.gl Layers It is now possible to use JSX syntax to create (or \"render\") deck.gl layers. Many React users feel that this results in a more natural coding style. There are limitations (deck.gl layers are  not  React components), for more information see  Using deck.gl with React . deck.gl v5 Release date: Dec 21, 2017 All new additions to the official deck.gl 5.0 API are listed here. Note that in addition to the official new features in this release, deck.gl 5.0 also contains a number of significant under the hoods changes to prepare for new features and optimizations. Some of these are available as experimental APIs, see below. As always, for information on deprecations and how to update your code in response to any API changes, please read the deck.gl  upgrade Guide . DeckGL Component DeckGL: Control over DevicePixelRatio The new  useDevicePixels  prop on the  DeckGL  React component can be used to disable usage of full resolution on retina/HD displays. Disabling deck.gl's default behavior of always rendering at maximum device resolution can reduce the render buffer size with a factor of 4x on retina devices and lead to significant performance improvements on typical fragment shader bound rendering. This option can be especially interesting on \"retina\" type mobile phone displays where pixels are so small that the visual quality loss may be largely imperceptible. DeckGL: Layer Filtering A new  DeckGL  prop  layerFilter  gives the application an opportunity to filter out layers from the layer list during rendering and/or picking. Filtering can be done per layer or per viewport (experimental) or both. This enables techniques like adding helper layers that work as masks during picking but do not show up during rendering, or rendering different additional information in different viewports (experimental). DeckGL: Allow overriding canvas component style Users can now override the canvas size, position and offset via the style prop passed to the DeckGL component. Layer Improvements Layer: Automatic Highlighting of Hovered Elements Three new  Layer  props ( autoHighlight ,  highlightColor  and  highlightedObjectIndex ) have been added to enable simple and efficient highlighting of a single object in a layer. Highlighting is either automatic on hover, or programmatically controlled through specifying the index of the selected object. The actual highlighting is done on the GPU and this feature is thus very performant, in particular as it lets applications avoid cumbersome techniques like modifying data or using a secondary layer for highlighting. See our  blog post CompositeLayer: Property Forwarding Support A new method  CompositeLayer.getSubLayerProps()  simplifies forwarding base layer props to sub layers, removing code clutter and reducing the risk of forgetting to forward an important base layer property. PathLayer & GeoJsonLayer: Dashed Line Support Added new props ( getDashArray  and  dashJustified ) enabling you render paths as dashed lines. Naturally these props are also accessible in composite layers built on top of the  PathLayer , such as the  GeoJsonLayer . PolygonLayer & GeoJsonLayer: Elevation Scale Added new prop  elevationScale  to enable fast scaling elevation of all extruded polygons. HexagonLayer / GridLayer: Elevation by Value Support Add  getElevationValue  to  HexagonLayer  and  GridLayer  to enable elevation aggregation by value. This allow both color and elevation to be calculated based on customized aggregation function. Seer Improvements The  Seer  Chrome Debug Extension now remembers its \"on/off\" setting across application reloads. This is significant because it means that the Seer extension can be left installed even in heavy deck.gl applications with lots of layers, and turned on only during debugging, without any performance impact during normal usage. Shader Modules Note: This change is mainly relevant to developers who write custom deck.gl layers. Shader module documentation is much improved, both in deck.gl and luma.gl. In the deck.gl docs, shader modules are listed in the \"API Reference\" section, after the JavaScript classes. The  project  module provides a new function  project_pixel_to_clipspace  for screen space calculations that takes variables like  useDevicePixels  and \"focal distance\" into account, making pixel space calculation simpler and less prone to fail when parameters change. The core deck.gl shader modules ( project  etc) now conform to the luma.gl shadertools conventions for naming uniforms and functions, making this module easier to describe and use. In spite of these changes, backwards compatible uniforms are provided to ensure that existing layers do not break. React Integration React 16 Support deck.gl v5 now supports React 16 and the  package.json  dependencies of all React-based examples have updated to React 16. Experimental Features As usual, deck.gl 5.0 contains a number of experimental features, e.g. \"multi viewport\", \"first person viewport\" and \"viewport transitions\". These features are still being finalized and the APIs have not been frozen, but can still be accessed by early adopters. See the roadmap article for more information on these. deck.gl v4.1 Release date: July 27th, 2017 WebGL2 Support (provided by luma.gl v4) deck.gl v4.1 is based on luma.gl v4, a major release that adds full WebGL2 support as well as powerful features like WebGL state management and an improve GLSL shader module system. On all browsers that supports WebGL2 (e.g. recent Chrome and Firefox browsers), deck.gl will obtain WebGL2 context and utilize WebGL2 functionalities. To know more about WebGL2, please check  here . Query Methods Two new functions -  DeckGL.queryObject  and  DeckGL.queryVisibleObjects  allow developers to directly query the picking results, in addition to handling picking via built-in click and hover callbacks. This allows applications to build more advanced event handling and makes deck.gl easier to integrate with existing applications that have already implemented their own event handling. In addition, the  queryObject  offers a much requested  radius  parameter, allowing the application to specify how close an object needs to be to the specified coordinate to be considered a match (in deck.gl v4.0, picking will only trigger if an object is actually visible on the queried pixel, making it hard for users to select small features and thin lines). Shader Assembly For developers that write their own custom layers, the  shadertools  shader assembly system is now in place to replace the existing  assembleShaders  function in deck.gl. The new shader assembler system supports organizing shader code into modules and is integrated with luma.gl's  Model  so users no longer need to call  assembleShaders  before creating the  Model  for the layer. Per-Layer Control of WebGL Parameters The base  Layer  class (which is inherited by all layers) supports a new property  parameters  that allows applications to specify the state of WebGL parameters such as blending mode, depth testing etc. This provides applications with significant control over the detailed rendering of layers. Note that the new  parameters  prop directly leverages the luma.gl v4  setParameters  API, which allows all WebGL parameters to be specified as keys in a single parameter object. Layer Attribute Control Pre-calculated \"Vertex Attributes\" can now be passed as props, meaning that developers that are willing to learn how a deck.gl layer's vertex attributes are structured can pass in typed arrays as props to the layer and have these directly passed to the GPU. This prevents the layer's internal  AttributeManager  from generating the attributes from your data, allowing you to optimize by e.g. directly passing in binary data from calculations or a binary file load without having deck.gl do any transformation on your data. CompositeLayer Composite layers, which were introduced in v4.0, have received some polish and performance improvements. In subclassed  CompositeLayer s, the  renderLayers  function can now return a nested array that could contain  null  values, and deck.gl will automatically flatten, filter and render all layers in the array. This is a small convenience that can make your  renderLayers  methods in complex composite layers a little more readable. Also, as a performance improvements, deck.gl now avoids \"rerendering\" sublayers of  CompositeLayer  whose props haven't changed. New Examples Several new examples have been added to illustrate the wide applicability of deck.gl. To name a few: Wind visualization in US. This example is featured on  OpenVIS 2017 by @philogb . This example shows how new features in WebGL2 can be used to accelerate compute intensive tasks through GPU computing right in the browsers Tagmap - This example by @rivulet-zhang shows some novel approching in placing and rendering text symbols in deck.gl Point cloud example - The point cloud example shows how deck.gl could be used to render large amount of 3D point cloud data without any basemap context. Node-link Graph - This is another example showing how deck.gl could be extended to the info-vis domain. Touch Support deck.gl's default event handling now includes support for multitouch gestures to zoom and rotate the view. In addition, a new  EventManager  class solidifies deck.gl's support for event handling. Seer Integration deck.gl is now integrated with the new  Seer Chrome extension . Simply installing Seer and rerunning your application opens up a new tab in the Chrome developer tools, providing you with the ability to see all your deck.gl layers, inspect (and edit) their properties and attributes and check per layer timings, such as the latest GPU draw calls or attribute updates. And note that since luma.gl v4 also has a Seer integration, it is possible to follow links from deck.gl layer to luma.gl models inside Seer, enabling you to further drill down and understand what data is ultimately being generated and processed by the GPU. deck.gl v4.0 Release date: March 31, 2017 Highlights New Geospatial Layers  GeoJsonLayer, PathLayer, PolygonLayer, IconLayer, GridCellLayer, HexagonCellLayer, PointCloudLayer. New Aggregating Layers  GridLayer and HexagonLayer now join the ScreenGridLayer in a growing family of layers that automatically \"bin\" your point data, in this case into grid cells or hexagons. New Examples  deck.gl now provides multiple stand-alone examples, with minimal configuration files ( package.json ,  webpack.config.js  etc) intended to make it easy to just copy an example folder and get an app up and running in minutes. Unified 64-bit Layers  - 64-bit Layers are now unified with 32-bit layers, controlled via a new  fp64  prop. Library Size Reduction  - A number of npm package dependencies have been trimmed from deck.gl, and the distribution has initial support for \"tree-shaking\" bundlers like webpack2 and rollup. Performance  A number of improvements across the core library and layers improves rendering and picking performance. Model Matrix Support  - Model matrix support for the  METER_OFFSET  projection mode enables arbitrary coordinate transforms (translations, rotations, scaling etc) to be applied on individual layer enabling scene graph like layer composition and animation. Documentation  Improved and reorganized in response to user feedback. Experimental Features  Experimental support for non-Mercator projections and rendering effects (e.g. Reflections) New Layers GeoJsonLayer A layer that parses and renders GeoJson. Supports all GeoJson primitives (polygons, lines and points).\nThe GeoJsonLayer is an example of a composite layer that instantiates other layers (in this case  PathLayer ,  PolygonLayer  and  ScatterplotLayer ) to do the actual rendering. This layer replaces the now deprecated family of  ChoroplethLayer s. PathLayer Takes a sequence of coordinates and renders them as a thick line with mitered or rounded end caps. PolygonLayer Each object in data is expected to provide a \"closed\" sequence of coordinates and renders them as a polygon, optionally extruded or in wireframe mode. Supports polygons with holes. IconLayer Allows the user to provide a texture atlas and a JSON configuration specifying where icons are located in the atlas. GridLayer A layer that draws rectangular, optionally elevated cells. A typical grid based heatmap layer. Differs from the  ScreenGridLayer  in that the cells are in world coordinates and pre aggregated. HexagonLayer A layer that draws hexagonal, optionally elevated cells. Point Cloud Layer Draws a LiDAR point cloud. Supports point position/normal/color. Improvements to all Layers Support for Per-Layer Model Matrix Each layer now supports a  modelMatrix  property that can be used to specify a local coordinate system for the data in that layer: Model matrices can dramatically simplify working with data in different coordinate systems, as the data does not need to be pre-transformed into a common coordinate system. Model matrices also enable interesting layer animation and composition possibilities as individual layers can be scaled, rotated, translated etc with very low computational cost (i.e. without modifying the data). UpdateTriggers now accept Accessor Names updateTriggers  now accept Accessor Names. The  updateTriggers  mechanism in deck.gl v3 required the user to know the name of the vertex attribute controlled by an accessor. It is now possible to supply names of  accessors . More intuitive mouse events onHover  is now only fired on entering/exiting an object instead of on mouse move. onClick  is now only fired on the picked layer instead of all pickable layers. New Features for Layer Subclassing Overridable Shaders All layers now have a  getShaders  method that can be overridden by subclasses, enables reuse of all layer code while just replacing one or both shaders, often dramatically reducing the amount of code needed to add a small feature or change to en existing layers. New Features for Layer Writers defaultProps Layers are now encouraged to define a  defaultProps  static member listing their props and default values, rather than programmatically declaring the props in constructor parameters etc. Using  defaultProps  means that many layer classes no longer need a constructor. AttributeManager now accepts new  accessor  field Can be a string or a an array of strings. Will be used to match  updateTriggers  accessor names with instance attributes. getPickingInfo() This method replaces the old  pick()  method and is expected to return an info object. Layers can block the execution of callback functions by returning  null . Performance A number of performance improvements and fixes have been gradually introduced since deck.gl v3.0 was launched. While many are not new in v4.0, cumulatively they enable noticeably better framerates and a lighter footprint when big data sets are loaded, compared to the initial v3.0.0 version. The  AttributeManager  class now supports default logging of timings for attribute updates. This logging can be activated by simply setting  deck.log.priority=2  in the console (levels 1 and 2 provide different amounts of detail). This can be very helpful in verifying that your application is not triggering unnecessary attribute updates. In addition, the new function  AttributeManager.setDefaultLogFunctions  allows the app to install its own custom logging functions to take even more control over logging of attribute updates. Library Improvements JavaScript build tooling continues to evolve and efforts have been made to ensure deck.gl supports several popular new tooling setups: Dependency Reduction  The number of npm dependencies (both in  deck.gl ,  luma.gl  and  react-map-gl ) have been reduced considerably, meaning that installing deck.gl and related modules will bring in less additional JavaScript code into your app, and your app will build and run faster. Tree-shaking support : deck.gl and related libraries now publish a \"module\" entry point in package.json which points to a parallel distribution ( deck.gl/dist-es6 ) that preserves the  import  and  export  statements. This should allow tree shaking bundlers such as webpack 2 and rollup to further reduce bundle size. Pure ES6 source code : With few exceptions (e.g some JSX usage in examples), the source code of deck.gl and related modules are now all restricted to conformant ES6 (i.e. no ES2016 or ES2017, flow or similar syntax is used). This means that the source code can run directly (ie. without transpilation) in Node.js and modern browsers. You could potentially import code directly from  deck.gl/src  to experiment with this. Buble support  in examples.  Buble  is a nice alternative to babel if you have a simple app and don't need all the power of babel. Many of the examples now use buble for faster and smaller builds. Examples Code examples have been improved in several ways: Multiple Examples  deck.gl now provides multiple different examples in an  examples  folder, showing various interesting uses of deck.gl. Stand Alone Examples  Examples are now stand alone, each with its own minimal  package.json  and configuration files, enabling them to be easily copied and modified. Hello World Examples  Minimal examples for building with webpack 2 and browserify (previously called \"exhibits\") are still provided, and have been further simplified. Layer Browser  The main  layer-browser  example has been expanded into a full \"layer and property browser\" allowing for easy testing of layers. Deprecations The various Choropleth layers have been deprecated since deck.gl has new and better layers ( GeoJsonLayer ,  PathLayer ,  PolygonLayer ) that fill the same roles. The choropleth layers are still available but will not be maintained beyond critical bug fixes and will likely be removed in the next major version of deck.gl. A careful API audit has also been done to align property names between old and\nnew layers. While this will makes the layers more consistent and the combined API easier to learn and work with, it does mean that some properties have been renamed, with the old name being deprecated, and in some very few cases, default values have changed. For more information on deprecations and how to update your code in response to these changes, please consult the deck.gl  Upgrade Guide . deck.gl v3.0 Release date: November, 2016 Highlights New website Comprehensive documentation All Core Layers updated (API, features, performance) 64-bit Layers (High Precision) METERS projection mode (High Precision) Multi-Primitive Layer Support Composite Layer Support React Integration DeckGL  ( DeckGLOverlay  in v2) component now requires a separate import ( import DeckGL from 'deck.gl/react' ). This allows the core deck.gl library to be imported by non-React applications without pulling in React. Adds  onLayerClick  and  onLayerHover  props to the  DeckGL  React component. The  DeckGL  component now cancels animation loop on unmount, important when repeatedly creating/destroying deck.gl components. The  DeckGL  component no longer manages WebGL blending modes, as this is better done directly by layers. Layers All layers now support accessors, removing the need for applications to transform data before passing it to deck.gl. Layer props and accessors now always expect arrays (e.g. colors are expected as  [r,g,b,a]  instead of  {r,g,b,a}  etc). line widths now takes device pixel ratio into account for more consistent look between displays METERS projection mode allows specifying positions in meter offsets in addition to longitude/latitude. Layers now receive viewport information from the  DeckGL  component. This implies that apps no longer need to pass the  width ,  height ,  longitude ,  latitude ,  zoom ,  pitch ,  bearing  and  bearing  props to each layer. These properties only need to be passed to the  DeckGL  react component. Base Layer deepCompare  prop replaced with more flexible  dataComparator ArcLayer Specify separate start and end color for each arc. Renders smoother arcs, especially for bottom arc segments close to map Fixes flickering last segments ScatterplotLayer Adds drawOutline option. ScreenGridLayer New name for deck.gl v2 GridLayer Now have accessors (getPosition, getWeight) Custom color ramps (minColor, maxColor) ChoroplethLayer Now renders MultiPolygons and Polygons with holes HexagonLayer (REMOVED) The v2 HexagonLayer has not yet been ported to v3. 64bit layers A set of new high precision layers that support extreme zoom levels ArcLayer64 (NEW) ChoroplethLayer64 (NEW) ScatterplotLayer64 (NEW) 64 bit ExtrudedChoroplethLayer (NEW) Great for rendering 3D buildings on top of maps Includes a basic shading model GeoJsonLayer (NEW, EXPERIMENTAL) Initial composite layer, only Polygons for now. Sample Layers Sample layers now available through  import 'deck.gl/samples'; Changes affecting Custom Layers Streamlined life cycle methods The Layer life cycle methods are now optimized for deck.gl's needs and no longer try to mimic React. Limited compatibility with deck.gl v2 is provided but it is strongly recommended to update layers to the new methods Optimizations Uint8Array  encoding is now supported for color and picking color attributes, which provides significant GPU memory savings. GLSL package manager and modules All layers now use  assembleShaders  to inject GLSL packages and platform\nfixes GLSL  project  package GLSL  fp64  emulated double precision floating point package GLSL  fp32  package - 32bit improved precision library Adds high precision version of trigonometry functions and  tan Especially for Intel GPUs deck.gl v2 Release date: May 2016 Highlights 3D Perspective Mode Performance: Huge under the hood refactor of layer update logic Automatic attribute management ( AttributeManager  class) Linux fixes - deck.gl and luma.gl now work on Linux.
